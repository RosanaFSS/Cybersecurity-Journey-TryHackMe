<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 170-day-streak. Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

Have you ever wondered why you need an IP address to access the Internet? Is it true that an IP address can uniquely identify the user? Are you curious to learn what the life of a packet looks like? If the answer is yes, let’s dive in!

This room is the first room in a series of four rooms dedicated to introducing the user to vital networking concepts and the most common networking protocols:

Networking Concepts (this room)
Networking Essentials
Networking Core Protocols
Networking Secure Protocols
Room Prerequisites
This room expects that you know terms such as IP address and TCP port number; however, we don’t expect that the reader is able to explain such terms in proper technical depth. If you are unfamiliar with these terms, please consider joining the Pre Security path.

Learning Objectives
By the time you finish this room, you will have learned about the following:

ISO OSI network model
IP addresses, subnets, and routing
TCP, UDP, and port numbers
How to connect to an open TCP port from the command line
