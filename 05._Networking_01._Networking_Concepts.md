<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 170-day-streak. Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/networkingconcepts">Networking Concepts</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered why you need an IP address to access the Internet? Is it true that an IP address can uniquely identify the user? Are you curious to learn what the life of a packet looks like? If the answer is yes, let’s dive in!<br><br>

This room is the first room in a series of four rooms dedicated to introducing the user to vital networking concepts and the most common networking protocols:</p>

<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Networking Concepts (this room)</li>
  <li>Networking Essentials</li>
  <li>Networking Core Protocols</li>
  <li>Networking Secure Protocols</li>
</ol></p>

<h2>Room Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This room expects that you know terms such as IP address and TCP port number; however, we don’t expect that the reader is able to explain such terms in proper technical depth. If you are unfamiliar with these terms, please consider joining the Pre Security path.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p></p>By the time you finish this room, you will have learned about the following:
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>ISO OSI network model</li>
  <li>IP addresses, subnets, and routing</li>
  <li>TCP, UDP, and port numbers</li>
  <li>How to connect to an open TCP port from the command line</li>
</ol></p>

> 1.1 - <em>Get your notepad ready, and let’s begin.</em><br>
>> <strong>No answer needed</strong><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 2 - OSI Model</h2>

<p>Before we start, we should note that the OSI model might initially seem complicated. Don’t worry if you encounter cryptic acronyms, as we provide examples of the OSI model layers. We assure you that by the time you finish this module, this task will feel like a piece of cake.<br><br>

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that describes how communications should occur in a computer network. In other words, the OSI model defines a framework for computer network communications. Although this model is theoretical, it is vital to learn and understand as it helps grasp networking concepts on a deeper level. The OSI model is composed of seven layers:</p>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Physical Layer</li>
  <li>Data Link Layer</li>
  <li>Transport Layer</li>
  <li>Session Layer</li>
  <li>Presentation Layer</li>
  <li>Application Layer</li>
</ol></p>

    <td style="background-color: yellow">The physical layer, also referred to as layer 1, deals with the physical connection between devices; this includes the medium, such as a wire, and the definition of the binary digits 0 and 1. Data transmission can be via an electrical, optical, or wireless signal. Consequently, we need data cables or antennas, depending on our physical medium.<br>In addition to Ethernet cable, shown in the illustration below, and optical fibre cable, examples of the physical layer medium include the WiFi radio bands, the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, and the 6 GHz band. </td>
