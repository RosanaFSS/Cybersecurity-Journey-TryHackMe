<h5 aling="center"><em>As SOC-mas approached, so did the need,<br>
To provide those without, with something to read.<br>
Care4Wares tried, they made it their mission,<br>
A gift for all wares, a SOC-mas tradition.<br>
Although they had some, they still needed more,<br>
To pick up some books, they‚Äôd head to the store.<br>
The town‚Äôs favourite books, would no doubt make them jolly,<br>
They ticked off the list, as they filled up the trolley.<br>
With the last book ticked off, the shopping was done,<br>
When asked for their card, the ware handed them one.<br>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù he said, as the shop clerk reclined,<br>
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sell you these books, as your card has declined.‚Äù<br>
The ware put them back, as they walked in confusion,<br>
How could this be? An attack? An intrusion?<br>
And when they logged on, the ware got a scare,<br>
To find the donations, they just weren‚Äôt there!</em></h5>

<p>Mayor Malware slammed his hand on the table, his eyes narrowing as the report flashed on his screen. Glitch and McSkidy had uncovered his trail. He took a deep breath, calming himself. "No matter," he muttered, a sinister grin forming. "They may have found me but haven't stopped me." His confidence stemmed from the malware he had crafted‚Äîso devious and advanced that it would easily evade detection.<br>

But before unleashing it to wreak havoc on SOC teams and ruin SOC-mas, there was one final step. He needed to test it in a sandbox.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>While it might seem like using the SOC superpower makes things super easy, that is not always the case. There are cases which can act as Kryptonite to the SOC superpower
    
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
