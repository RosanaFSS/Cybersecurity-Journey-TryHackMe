<h1>Task 1 . IoT . Royal Router</h1>
<p>Cipher exposes a crucial router at the edge of his network, creating a narrow window for potential intrusions.  It could grant access to the internal network where he stores his operations and compromised systems.<br>

The VM needs 5 minutes to properly boot up.</p>

# Cve: CVE-2018-15839

# Proof Of Concept:

1- First connect to this network
2- Open BurpSuite and then start the intercept, making the necessary proxy changes to the internet browser.
3- Goto Easy setup > 
4- Now as the Burp is intercept is on, you will find an Authorization: Basic or cookie: SessionId followed by a string. Now we paste a string consisting oaf 5000 zeros.
5- Then forward the connection
6- Then your router automatically log out and the net connection will be gone.
