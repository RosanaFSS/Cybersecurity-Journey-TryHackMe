<h2>Task 1 . Intro</h2>
<p>Preface:

Welcome to 2. MP: Research section of my malware analysis series. <br><br>

 

Although we will be covering some cryptography theory, I've kept it relevant and visualised it as best I can. I've provided some resources at the end of the room in the "Further Reading" task for each of the topics covered. <br><br>

You can expect to learn about file checksums, why these values are important in not only day-to-day life but more so how we can utilise them in malware analysis. The first few tasks are theory-heavy, so bear with me. However, towards the end of the room, you will be generating your own checksums, learning how to use online sandboxing, and analysing the reports generated from these.<br><br>

.:.<br><br>

As always, any feedback regarding the content covered through the series so far is greatly appreciated. I always welcome ideas of topics, tools, and techniques that could be covered.<br><br>
