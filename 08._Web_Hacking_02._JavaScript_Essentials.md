<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my <strong><em>173</em></strong>-day-streak.<br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

Let’s quickly compare this with correspondence in the cyber realm. When someone sends you a text message, how can you be sure they are who they claim to be? How can you be sure that nothing changed the text as it travelled across various network links? When you are communicating with your business partner over an online messaging platform, you need to be sure of the following:<br><br>


<p>First, let’s start the <code>Virtual Machine</code> by pressing the <code>Start Machine</code> button below.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Essentials Concepts</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables are containers that allow you to store data values in them. Like any other language, variables in JS are similar to containers to store data. When you store something in a bucket, you also need to label it so that it can be referenced later on easily. Similarly, in JS, each variable has a name; when we store a certain value in a variable, we assign a name to it to reference it later. image of var, let and const typesThere are three ways to declare variables in JS: var, let, and const. While var is function-scoped, both let, and const are block-scoped, offering better control over variable visibility within specific code blocks.</p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>In JS, data types define the type of value a variable can hold. Examples include string (text), number, boolean (true/false), null, undefined, and object (for more complex data like arrays or objects).</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>A function represents a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Inside a function, you group code that needs to perform a similar task. For example, you are developing a web application in which you need to print students' results on the web page. The ideal case would be to create a function PrintResult(rollNum) that would accept the roll number of the user as an argument.</p>

<p>So, instead of writing the same print code for all the students, we will use a simple function to print the result.</p>

<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>Loops allow you to run a code block multiple times as long as a condition is true. Common loops in JS are for, while, and do...while, which are used to repeat tasks, like going through a list of items. For example, if we want to print the results of 100 students, we can call the PrintResult(rollNum) function 100 times by writing it 100 times, or we can create a loop that will be iterated through 1 to 100 and will call the PrintResult(rollNum) function as shown below.</p>

<h3>Request-Response Cycle</h3>
<p>In web development, the request-response cycle is when a user's browser (the client) sends a request to a web server, and the server responds with the requested information. This could be a webpage, data, or other resources. You can learn more about it here.</p>
