<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my <strong><em>173</em></strong>-day-streak.<br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

Let’s quickly compare this with correspondence in the cyber realm. When someone sends you a text message, how can you be sure they are who they claim to be? How can you be sure that nothing changed the text as it travelled across various network links? When you are communicating with your business partner over an online messaging platform, you need to be sure of the following:<br><br>


<p>First, let’s start the <code>Virtual Machine</code> by pressing the <code>Start Machine</code> button below.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Essentials Concepts</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables are containers that allow you to store data values in them. Like any other language, variables in JS are similar to containers to store data. When you store something in a bucket, you also need to label it so that it can be referenced later on easily. Similarly, in JS, each variable has a name; when we store a certain value in a variable, we assign a name to it to reference it later. image of var, let and const typesThere are three ways to declare variables in JS: var, let, and const. While var is function-scoped, both let, and const are block-scoped, offering better control over variable visibility within specific code blocks.</p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>In JS, data types define the type of value a variable can hold. Examples include string (text), number, boolean (true/false), null, undefined, and object (for more complex data like arrays or objects).</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>A function represents a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Inside a function, you group code that needs to perform a similar task. For example, you are developing a web application in which you need to print students' results on the web page. The ideal case would be to create a function PrintResult(rollNum) that would accept the roll number of the user as an argument.</p>

<p>So, instead of writing the same print code for all the students, we will use a simple function to print the result.</p>

<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>Loops allow you to run a code block multiple times as long as a condition is true. Common loops in JS are for, while, and do...while, which are used to repeat tasks, like going through a list of items. For example, if we want to print the results of 100 students, we can call the PrintResult(rollNum) function 100 times by writing it 100 times, or we can create a loop that will be iterated through 1 to 100 and will call the PrintResult(rollNum) function as shown below.</p>

<h3>Request-Response Cycle</h3>
<p>In web development, the request-response cycle is when a user's browser (the client) sends a request to a web server, and the server responds with the requested information. This could be a webpage, data, or other resources. You can learn more about it here.</p>

<h3>JavaScript Overview</h3>
<p>In this task, we’ll use JS to create our first program. JS is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed directly in the browser without prior compilation. Below is a sample JS code demonstrating key concepts, such as defining a variable, understanding data types, using control flow statements, and writing simple functions. These essential building blocks help create more dynamic and interactive web apps. Don’t worry if it looks a bit new now - we will discuss each of these concepts in detail later on.</p>

<p>JS is primarily executed on the client side, which makes it easy to inspect and interact with HTML directly within the browser. We’ll use the Google Chrome Console feature to run our first JS program, allowing us to write and execute JS code easily without additional tools. Follow these steps to get started:</p>
- Open Google Chrome by clicking the Google Chrome icon on the Desktop of the VM.

- Once Chrome is open, press Ctrl + Shift + I to open the Console or right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect.

- Then, click on the Console tab. This console allows you to run JS code directly in the browser without installing additional software.

- Let's create a simple JS program that adds two numbers and displays the result. Below is the code:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac7f677-3e8a-448b-a7dc-8efe56848af3)

- In the code above, x and y are variables holding the numbers. x + y is an expression that adds the two numbers together, whereas console.log  is a function used to print the result to the console.
- Copy the above code and paste it into the console by pressing the key Ctrl + V. Once pasted, press Enter. You should see the result displayed as:

<p>ngratulations! You’ve successfully created your first program in JS. This is just the beginning, and there’s much more to explore as we dive deeper into JS in this room.</p>
