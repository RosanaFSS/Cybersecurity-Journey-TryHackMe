<h2>Task 1. Find the flags</h2>
<br>

<p>The Lookback company has just started the integration with Active Directory. Due to the coming deadline, the system integrator had to rush the deployment of the environment. Can you spot any vulnerabilities?<br>

Start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. You may access the VM using the AttackBox or your VPN connection. This machine does not respond to ping (ICMP).<br>
<br>
Can you find all the flags?<br>
The VM takes about 5/10 minutes to fully boot up.</p>
