<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my <strong>173</strong>-day-streak.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/sqlmapthebasics">SQLMap: The Basics</a>.</p><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>
<p>SQL injection is a prevalent vulnerability and has long been a hot topic in cyber security. To understand this vulnerability, we must first learn what a database is and how websites interact with a database.<br>

A database is a collection of data that can be stored, modified, and retrieved. It stores data from several applications in a structured format, making storage, modification, and retrieval easy and efficient. You interact with several websites daily. The website contains some of the web pages where user input is required. For instance, a website with a login page asks you to enter your credentials, and once you enter them, it checks if the credentials are correct and logs you in if they are. As many users log in to that website, how does that website record all these users’ data and verify it during the authentication process? This is all done with the help of a database. These websites have databases that store the user and other information and retrieve it when needed. So when you enter your credentials to a website’s login page, the website interacts with its database to check if these credentials are correct. Similarly, if you have an input field to search for something, for instance, an input field of a bookshop website allows you to search for the available books for sale. When you search for any book, the website will interact with the database to fetch the record of that book and display it on the website.<br>

Now, we know that the website asks the database to retrieve, store, or modify any data. So, how does this interaction take place? The databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Microsoft SQL Server. These systems understand the Structured Query Language (SQL). So, any application or website uses SQL queries when interacting with the database.</p>

<p>This room will teach you the basics of SQL injection and how to use an automated tool to carry out SQL injection. It will also dive into a practical, hands-on challenge and teach you the preventive measures for this vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>SQL injection vulnerability</li>
    <li>Hunting SQL injection through the SQLMap tools</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Room Prerequisites</h3>
<p>While having a solid <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/sqlfundamentals">SQL Fundamentals</a> knowledge is helpful, it is not required to complete this room.</p><br>

> 1.1 - <em>Which language builds the interaction between a website and its database?</em>
>> <strong>SQL</strong>
<p></p><br>

<h2>Task 2 - SQL Injection Vulnerability</h2>
<br>

> 2.1 - <em>Which boolean operator checks if at least one side of the operator is true for the condition to be true?</em>
>> <strong>No answer needed</strong>
<p></p><br>

> 2.2 - <em>Is 1=1 in an SQL query always true? (YEA/NAY)</em>
>> <strong>No answer needed</strong>
<p></p><br>

<pre><code>$ root@ip-[REDACTED]:~# sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ # You can change settings by editing this file.
# Defaults can be restored by simply deleting this file.
#
# See resolved.conf(5) for details

>> <strong>_______________</strong>
<p></p><br>

<h2>Task 4 - Use Case: Directory and File Enumeration</h2>
<br>

> 4.1 - <em>Which flag do we have to add to our command to skip the TLS verification? Enter the long flag notation.</em>
>> <strong>_______________</strong>
<p></p><br>

> 4.2 - <em>Which flag do we have to add to our command to skip the TLS verification? Enter the long flag notation.</em>
>> <strong>_______________</strong>
<p></p><br>

> 4.3 - <em>Continue enumerating the directory found in question 2. You will find an interesting file there with a .js extension. What is the flag found in this file?</em>
>> <strong>_______________</strong>
<p></p><br>

<h2>Task 5 - Use Case: Subdomain Enumeration</h2>
<br>

> 5.1 - <em>Apart from the dns keyword and the <code>-w</code> flag, which <code>shorthand flag</code> is required for the command to work?</em>
>> <strong>_______________</strong>
<p></p><br>
