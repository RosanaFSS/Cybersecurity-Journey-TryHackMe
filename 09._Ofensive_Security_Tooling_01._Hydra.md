<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my <strong>173</strong>-day-streak.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/hydra">Hydra</a>.</p><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Hydra Inroduction</h2>
<h3>What is Hydra?</h3>

<p>Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool.<br>

Hydra can run through a list and “brute force” some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone’s password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.<br>

https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra

According to its official repository, Hydra supports, i.e., has the ability to brute force the following protocols: “Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.”<br>

For more information on the options of each protocol in Hydra, you can check the Kali Hydra tool page.<br>

This shows the importance of using a strong password; if your password is common, doesn’t contain special characters and is not above eight characters, it will be prone to be guessed. A one-hundred-million-password list contains common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to log in, change it from the default! CCTV cameras and web frameworks often use <code>admin:password</code> as the default login credentials, which is obviously not strong enough.</p>

<h3>Installing Hydra</h3>
<p>Hydra is already installed on the AttackBox. You can access it by clicking on the <code>Start AttackBox</code> button.<br>

If you prefer to use the in-browser Kali machine, Hydra also comes pre-installed, as is the case with all Kali distributions. You can access it by selecting Use Kali Linux and clicking on Start Kali Linux button.<br>

However, you can check its official repositories if you prefer to use another Linux distribution. For instance, you can install Hydra on an Ubuntu or Fedora system by executing <code>apt install hydra</code> or <code>dnf install hydra</code>. Furthermore, you can download it from its official THC-Hydra repository.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Using Hydra</h2>
<p>Start the AttackBox by pressing the <code>Start AttackBox</code>code> button at the top of this page. The AttackBox machine will start in Split-Screen view. If it is not visible, use the blue <code>Show Split View</code> button at the top of the page.<br>

Press the green <code>Start Machine</code> button below to deploy the machine attached to this task, then navigate to <code>http://MACHINE_IP</code> <em>on the AttackBox (this machine can take up to 3 minutes to boot)</em></p>

<h3>Hydra Commands</h3>
<p>The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being <code>user</code> and a password list being <code>passlist.txt</code>, we’d use the following command:

<code>hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP</code>

For this deployed machine, here are the commands to use Hydra on SSH and a web form (POST method).</p>

<h3>SSH</h3>
<code>hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh</full>code>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6257b453-1d5f-4e57-9de8-688b7cce893d)

<p>For example, <code>hydra -l root -P passwords.txt MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh</code> will run with the following arguments:</p>

Hydra will use <code>root</code> as the username for <code>ssh</code>
It will try the passwords in the <code>passwords.txt</code> file
There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by <code>-t 4</code>

<h3>Post Web Form</h3>
<p>We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.<br>

<code>sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"</code></p>


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feaefc6d-8364-44e1-acd0-7a425a50d41a)

<p>Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

<code>hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V</code></p>

The login page is only <code>/</code>, i.e., the main IP address.
The <code>username</code> is the form field where the username is entered
The specified username(s) will replace <code>^USER^</code>
The <code>password</code> is the form field where the password is entered
The provided passwords will be replacing <code>^PASS^</code>
Finally, <code>F=incorrect</code> is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails

<p>You should now have enough information to put this to practice and brute force your credentials to the deployed machine!</p>
