<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>
<p>CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a <code>Swiss Army Knife</code> for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like <code>XOR</code> or <code>Base64</code> to complex operations like <code>AES encryption</code> or <code>RSA decryption</code>. CyberChef operates on <code>recipes</code>, a series of operations executed in order.</p>
