<br>

<p>Running <code>iw dev</code> and then <code>sudo iw dev wlan2 scan</code> we find a <code>BSSID</code> and <code>SSID</code> of the devicd of <code>02:00:00:00:00:00</code> and <code>MalwareM_AP</code>.</p>

<br>

<p>Now instead of <code>managed</code> type it is <code>monitor</code> type.a</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>From now on we will work with two terminals. One will sniff the packets on the network, and the other to execute commands. </p>

<br>

<p>Running <code>sudo airodum-ng wlan2</code> we we can see the Wireless Access Point that we already know is on the network.<br>
Here we can clearly see the <code>BSSID</code> of the router which is <code>02:00:00:00:00:00</code>, and also the <code>ESSID</code> which is <code>MalwareM_AP</code>.</p>

<p>I used <code>Ctrl + C</code> for <code>Quitting</code>.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>Oned more time we can see the <code>BSSID</code> of the router which is <code>02:00:00:00:00:00</code>, and also the <code>ESSID</code> which is <code>MalwareM_AP</code>.<br>
But this time it is only listening to that router and the output is captured on the file that we specified.<br>
It is necessary to allow 1 to 5 minutes to show which clients are connected to that router.<br>

And after that time, we can notice that one station has a different <code>BSSID</code> related to the previous one, which is <code>02:00:00:00:01:00</code>.<br>
<code>02:00:00:00:01:00</code> is a client connected to that router.</p>

<br>


<p>Next we will send an <code>authentication package</code> to our router to make it disconnect and force it to restablish the 4-way handshake where the ata encrypted with the <code>PSK</code> will be exchanged and then we can brute force it.</p>

<br>

<p>It "says" <code>directed DeAuth</code> which stands for the authentication.<br>
So we can notice that the <code>authentication</code> was successful.<br>
And we can also notice evidence of the 4-way handshake occurring.<br><br>
This means that in the file where we captured that output somewhere in this file is a captured challenge thatÂ´s is encrypted to <code>psk</code> that we can simply Brute Force to get the <code>psk</code>password.</p>

<br>

<p>Now we found the <code>KEY</code>c which is <code>fluffly/champ24</code>.</p>
