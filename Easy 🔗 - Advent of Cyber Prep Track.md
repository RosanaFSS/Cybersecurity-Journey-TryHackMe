<h2>Task 1 . Welcome to Advent of Cyber 2025</h2>
<h3>Welcome to Advent of Cyber 2025</h3>
<p>In this year’s Advent of Cyber, something isn't quite right in Wareville. Can you help save the town and their beloved SOC-mas tradition from the evil grasp of King Malhare?<br>

Dive into the wonderful world of cyber security by engaging in festive beginner-friendly challenges every day in the lead-up to Christmas!<br>

Advent of Cyber is available to all TryHackMe users, and best of all, it's free to participate in. You’ll also be in with the chance of winning from this year’s huge $150,000 prize draw. The more rooms you complete, the higher your chances of winning BIG!<p>

<h3>Main Prizes</h3>
<p>This year is our biggest and best prize draw yet, with over $150,000 worth of prizes!<br>

In this event, the number of rooms you complete really matters! For each question answered, you'll receive a raffle ticket. The more raffle tickets you collect, the higher your chances of winning big!<br>

Here are the prizes up for grabs:</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b46bd9df-84bd-4ec4-b49f-2b301fe5f5b1"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.<br><br>

<h3>Let's Get Warmed Up</h3>
<p>The snow has started falling in Wareville, home of The Best Festival Company (TBFC). The team is preparing for SOCMAS, the annual cyber celebration, but something’s not right. Systems are glitching, passwords are failing, and McSkidy suspects something is afoot. This name keeps coming up: King Malhare. What could it mean?<br>

Before joining the SOCMAS Response Team, you can complete 10 short missions to ensure you are ready. Each one teaches an essential cyber security skill and uncovers clues to help get you ready for Advent of Cyber 2025.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="400px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1865c8aa-d9b1-4516-b83e-8fc856e8c558"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>To start each challenge, click the “View Site” button in the top-right corner of the task page. You’ll need to press this button again for every new task, as each one loads its own challenge site. Once clicked, the room will open in a split-screen view, letting you follow the instructions on the left while interacting with the challenge on the right. This is where you’ll complete all of our interactive challenges to get you ready for this year's event!</p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>4.1. <em>Warm me up!</em><br>
<code>No answer needed</code></p>

<br>
<h2>Task 5 . Challenge 1  - Password Pandemonium</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19d916e-b181-479b-9ab0-51ecd977b196"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>Password Pandemonium</h3>
<p>As you log into your new TBFC workstation, an alert pops up:<br>

“Weak passwords detected on 73 TBFC accounts!”<br>

Even McSkidy’s password, P@ssw0rd123, has been flagged. Before gaining full access, you’ll need to prove your password prowess.<br>

Strong passwords are one of the simplest yet most effective defences against cyber attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Create a password that passes all system checks and isn’t found in the leaked password list.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Enter a password with at least 12 characters.</li>
  <li>Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.</li>
  <li>Ensure it isn’t in the breach database.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>5.1. <em>What's the flag?</em> Hint : Try phrases like “C4r0tsAreBad!” or “Reindeers>Eggs2025!”<br>
<code>THM{•••••••••••}</code></p>

<br>
<h2>Task 6 . Challenge 2  - The Suspicious Chocolate.exe</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd511eb-f006-4fb5-866e-ca705c1c6ef1"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>The Suspicious Chocolate.exe</h3>
<p>A shiny USB labelled “<strong>SOCMAS Party Playlist</strong>” appears on your desk. Inside is a mysterious file called <code>chocolate.exe</code>.<br>
It looks festive, but who sent it?<br>

In this challenge, you’ll scan the file using a simulated VirusTotal tool to decide whether it’s safe or malicious.<br>
Checking suspicious files is a crucial skill for every defender.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Determine if <code>chocolate.exe</code> is safe or infected.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Click the “Scan” Button.</li>
  <li>Review the scan report (49 clean results, 1 malicious).</li>
  <li>Decide correctly whether the file is safe or dangerous.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>6.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: One detection is all it takes — 49 clean results don’t mean it’s safe.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••}</code></p>

<br>
<h2>Task 7 . Challenge 3  - Welcme to the Attackbox!</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c059d29f-81d6-456a-89bf-07a4d735cc61"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>Welcome to the AttackBox!</h3>
<p>You step into TBFC’s <strong>AttackBox</strong>, a secure virtual environment built for training. The system hums quietly, waiting for your first command.<br>

This is where defenders learn, break, and rebuild safely. Getting comfortable with the command line is your first step toward cyber mastery.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Find and read the hidden welcome message inside your AttackBox.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Use <code>ls</code> to list files.</li>
  <li>Use <code>cd challenges/</code> to change directories.</li>
  <li>Use <code>cat welcome.txt</code> to read the text file.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>7.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: When lost, try pwd to see where you are.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd0e5df-162d-41e6-89ad-8e35757ea85c"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 8 . Challenge 4 - The CMD Conundrum</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6da2395-1283-4b70-b8a0-eb716f7ebb21"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>The CMD Conundrum</h3>
<p>McSkidy’s workstation shows signs of tampering, suspicious files moved, logs wiped, and a strange folder named <code>mystery_data</code>.<br>

It’s time to use the <strong>Windows Command Prompt</strong> to uncover what’s hidden.<br>
Learning these commands helps you investigate systems and find what the GUI can’t.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Find and read the hidden welcome message inside your AttackBox.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Use <code>dir</code> to list visible files.</li>
  <li>Use <code>dir /a</code> to reveal hidden ones.</li>
  <li>Use <code>type hidden_flag.txt</code> to read the flag.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>8.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: Hidden files love to hide in plain sight. Navigate into the folder with cd mystery_data. Use "cls" to clear the screen.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd051b1d-8de6-451b-96cd-4ec04d48072a"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 9 . Challenge 5 - Linux Lore</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6f2b308-06ae-41ac-8a24-935ede0392c6"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>Linux Lore</h3>
<p>TBFC’s delivery drones are glitching, dropping eggs instead of presents! McSkidy’s last login came from a Linux server, and something in his account might explain why.<br>

Linux powers most servers worldwide, and knowing how to search within it is a must for any defender.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Locate McSkidy’s hidden message in his Linux home directory.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Use <code>cd /home/mcskidy/</code> to enter his folder.</li>
  <li>Run <code>ls -la</code> to show all files.</li>
  <li>Use <code>cat .secret_message</code> to reveal the flag.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>9.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: In Linux, “.” (a dot) before a filename means it’s a hidden file.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad32fef0-7025-4553-8e74-c5d6bed596a2"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 10 . Challenge 6 - The Leak in the List</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a228a4-34be-4f58-8009-b9150afe2c7c"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>The Leak in the List</h3>
<p>Rumours swirl that TBFC’s data has been leaked. Emails are bouncing, and the staff are panicking.<br>
McSkidy suspects his account might have been part of a breach.<br>

Defenders often use tools like <strong>Have I Been Pwned</strong> to check for compromised accounts. Early detection can stop an attack from spreading.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Check if McSkidy’s email has appeared in a breach.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Enter <code>mcskidy@tbfc.com</code> into the breach checker.</li>
  <li>Review results for each domain.</li>
  <li>Identify the one marked “Compromised.”</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>10.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: HopSec has been quiet for years. Coincidence? Probably not.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87267b1c-eac1-4a5b-b38b-c6a087147cae"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 11 . Challenge 7 - WiFi Woes in Wareville</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bb69b20-d861-48c8-90d5-f559d1f2d850"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>WiFi Woes in Wareville</h3>
<p>The TBFC drones are looping endlessly over Wareville Square. Someone logged into the company router using default credentials!<br>

Securing WiFi is critical. Default passwords are like leaving the front gate wide open.</p>

Defenders often use tools like <strong>Have I Been Pwned</strong> to check for compromised accounts. Early detection can stop an attack from spreading.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Log into the router and secure it with a strong new password.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Log in with username <code>admin</code> and password <code>admin</code>.</li>
  <li>Go to “Security Settings.”</li>
  <li>Set a new strong password that passes validation.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>11.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: If your router came with a default password, change it right now.<br>
<code>THM{•••••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5482fb-78ef-4fbf-a4b2-d86a2b4caff2"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 12 . Challenge 8 - The App Trap</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d6c52d-fd08-4699-b2e2-2aac148dce53"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>The App Trap</h3>
<p>McSkidy’s social account has gone rogue, posting strange messages about “EASTMAS.” A suspicious third party app may be behind it.<br>

Learning to review and manage app permissions helps stop data leaks before they start.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Find and remove the malicious connected app.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Review the list of connected apps.</li>
  <li>Look for one with unusual permissions (like “password vault” access).</li>
  <li>Click “Revoke Access.”</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>12.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: No calendar app needs access to your password vault.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e49ad8c1-94c6-4b3a-866a-03b10ef33edf"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 13 . Challenge 9 - The Chatbot Confession</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d6c52d-fd08-4699-b2e2-2aac148dce53"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>The Chatbot Confession</h3>
<p>TBFC’s AI assistant, FestiveBot, was meant to help write cheerful emails, but it’s been spilling secrets.<br>
Some messages reveal internal URLs and even passwords.<br>

AI tools can be powerful, but defenders must know how to prevent them from oversharing.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Identify which chatbot messages contain sensitive information.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Read each line of the conversation.</li>
  <li>Select the ones containing private data.</li>
  <li>Submit your findings.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>13.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: Never give an AI your credentials, internal IPs, or unreleased plans.<br>
<code>THM{••••••••••••••}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b4edff-1844-405c-a12e-6789717f6519"></h6>

<br>
<h2>Task 14 . Challenge 10 - The Bunny´s Browser Trail</h2>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bb9897f-d6d7-4961-b407-3a144da2028f"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>The Bunny’s Browser Trail</h3>
<p>SOCMAS web servers are showing heavy traffic, but one log entry stands out:<br>

“<em>User Agent: BunnyOS/1.0 (HopSecBot)</em>”<br>

Someone or something has infiltrated the system.<br>
User Agent strings help defenders spot automated or suspicious visitors in network logs.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Find the unusual User Agent in the HTTP log.<br>
  
<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Read the provided web log entries.</li>
  <li>Compare them to common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).</li>
  <li>Identify and select the suspicious entry.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>14.1. <em>What´s the flag?</em> Hint: Look for something that isn’t a common browser — Chrome, Firefox, Edge are fine.<br>
<code>THM{EastmasIsComing}</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="1200px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35edee50-c1be-4877-b7b8-0ff7db6d35bd"></h6>
