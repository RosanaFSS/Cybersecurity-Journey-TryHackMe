<h2>Task 1 - Introduction to Incident Response</h2>
<p>Forensics is the application of methods and procedures to investigate and solve crimes. The branch of forensics that investigates cyber crimes is known as <strong>digital foresincs</strong>. <strong>Cyber crime</strong> is any criminal activity conducted on or using a digital device. Several tools and techniques are used to investigate digital devices thoroughly after any crime to find and analyze evidence for necessary legal action.<br><br>

Digital devices have solved many of our problems. Communication all around the globe is just a matter of a text or call. Due to the vast usage of digital devices, besides making life easier, an increase in digital crimes - cyber crimes has also been observed. A variety of crimes are committed using digital devices.<br><br>

Consider an example where law enforcement agencies raid a bank robber’s place with proper search warrants. Some digital devices, including a laptop, mobile phone, hard drive, and a USB, were found in the robber’s home. The law enforcement agency handed over the case to the digital forensics team. The team collected evidence securely and conducted a thorough investigation inside their digital forensics lab equipped with forensics tools. The following evidence was found on the digital devices:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>A digital map of the bank was found on the suspect’s laptop, which they kept for planning the robbery.</li>
    <li>A document with the bank’s entrance and escape routes was found on the suspect’s hard drive.</li>
    <li>A document on the hard drive that listed all the bank’s physical security controls. The suspect devised plans to bypass the security measures.</li>
    <li>Some media files, including photos and videos of the suspect’s previous robberies, were inside the suspect’s laptop.</li>
    <li>After conducting a thorough investigation of the suspect’s mobile phone, some illegal chat groups and call records related to the bank robbery were also found.</li>
</ul><br></p>
