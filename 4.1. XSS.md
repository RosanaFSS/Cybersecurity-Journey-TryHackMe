<h1>3. Causes and Implications</h1>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users. As a result, the unsuspecting users end up running the unauthorized script in their browsers, although the website they are visiting is trusted to be benign. Therefore, XSS can be a severe threat because it exploits users’ trust in a site.</p>

<h2>What Makes XSS Possible</h2>
<br>
<p>There are many reasons why XSS vulnerabilities are still found in web apps. Below, we list a few of them.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Insufficient input validation and sanitization</strong></h3>
<p>Web applications accept user data, e.g., via forms, and use this data in the dynamic generation of HTML pages. Consequently, malicious scripts can be embedded as part of the legitimate input and will eventually be executed by the browser unless adequately sanitized.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Lack of output encoding</strong></h3>
<p>The user can use various characters to alter how a web browser processes and displays a web page. For the HTML part, it is critical to properly encode characters such as <, >, ", ', and & into their respective HTML encoding. For JavaScript, special attention should be given to escape ', ", and \. Failing to encode user-supplied data correctly is a leading cause of XSS vulnerabilities.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Improper use of security headers</strong></h3>
<p>Various security headers can help mitigate XSS vulnerabilities. For example, Content Security Policy (CSP) mitigates XSS risks by defining which sources are trusted for executable scripts. A misconfigured CSP, such as overly permissive policies or the improper use of unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval directives, can make it easier for the attacker to execute their XSS payloads.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Framework and language vulnerabilities</strong></h3>
<p>Some older web frameworks did not provide security mechanisms against XSS; others have unpatched XSS vulnerabilities. Modern web frameworks automatically escape XSS by design and promptly patch any discovered vulnerability.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Third-party libraries</strong></h3>
<p>Integrating third-party libraries in a web application can introduce XSS vulnerabilities; even if the core web application is not vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Implications of XSS</h2>
<p>There are many implications of XSS. Below, we list a few of them.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Session hijacking</strong></h3>
<p>As XSS can be used to steal session cookies, attackers can take over the session and impersonate the victim if successful.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Phishing and credential theft</strong></h3>
<p>Leveraging XSS, attackers can present a fake login prompt to the user. In one recent case, the browser’s page was partially hidden by a dialogue box requesting users to connect to their cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Social engineering</strong></h3>
<p>Using XSS, an attacker can create a legitimate-looking pop-up or alert within a trusted website. This can trick users into clicking malicious links or visiting malicious websites.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Content manipulation and defacement</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to phishing and social engineering, an attacker might use XSS to change the website for other purposes, such as inflicting damage on the company’s reputation.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Data exfiltration</strong></h3>
<p>XSS can access and exfiltrate any information displayed on the user’s browser. This includes sensitive information such as personal data and financial information.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>. Malware installation</strong></h3>
<p>A sophisticated attacker can use XSS to spread malware. In particular, it can deliver drive-by download attacks on the vulnerable website.</p>

<br>
<h1>4. Reflected XSS</h1>
<p>Reflected XSS is a type of XSS vulnerability where a malicious script is reflected to the user’s browser, often via a crafted URL or form submission. Consider a search query containing <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>; many users wouldn’t be suspicious about such a URL, even if they look at it up close. If processed by a vulnerable web application, it will be executed within the context of the user’s browser.<br>

In this innocuous example, it displays the cookie in an alert box. Obviously, an attacker wants to achieve more than just displaying the cookie as an alert to the user. However, for such an attack to be possible, we need a vulnerable application.</p>

<h2>Vulnerable Web Application</h2>
<p>One simple reflected XSS vulnerability is when the user searches for some term, and the search string is included verbatim in the results page. This simple scenario provides an easy target for the attacker to exploit.<br>

Although discovering such vulnerabilities is not always easy, fixing them is straightforward. User input such as <script>alert('XSS')</script> should be santized or HTML-encoded to &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;.<br>

In the following subsections, we provide examples of vulnerable code in the following languages and frameworks:</p>
- PHP<br>
- JavaScript (Node.js)<br>
- Python (Flask)<br>
- C# (ASP.NET)<br>

<h2>PHP</h2>
<h3><strong>. Vulnerable code</strong></h3>
<p>Look at the following code snippet in PHP and figure out why it might be vulnerable to reflected XSS.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef507657-243a-4dea-b087-21182c0518be)

<p>If you are unfamiliar with PHP, $_GET is a PHP array containing values from the URL query string. Furthermore, $_GET['q'] refers to the query string parameter q. For example, in http://shop.thm/search.php?q=table, $_GET['q'] has the value table.<br>

As you might have guessed, the vulnerability is caused by the search value displayed on the result page without sanitization. Therefore, an attacker can add a malicious script to the URL, knowing it would be executed. For example, as a proof of concept, the following URL can be tested: http://shop.thm/search.php?q=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script> and if the site is vulnerable, an alert box will appear displaying the user’s cookie.</p>

<h3><strong>. Fixed code</strong></h3>
<p>Luckily, fixing this code is simple.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a49b36dc-c865-4374-9984-bd7474c76edb)

<p>The PHP function htmlspecialchars() converts special characters to HTML entities. The characters <, >, &, ", ' are replaced by default to prevent scripts in the input from executing. You can read its documentation here.</p>

<h2>JavaScript (Node.js)</h2>
<h3><strong>. Vulnerable code</strong></h3>
<p>The following Node.js code snippet is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Try to find the vulnerable part and think of a solution.</p>

<h3><strong>. Fixed code</strong></h3>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12c52534-1327-47cc-a419-6ebbb2e76511)

<p>The solution is achieved by using the sanitizeHtml() from the sanitize-html library. This function removes unsafe elements and attributes. This includes removing script tags, among other elements that could be used for malicious purposes. You can read its documentation here.<br>

Another approach would be by using the escapeHtml() function instead of the sanitizeHtml() function. As the name indicates, the escapeHtml() function aims to escape characters such as <, >, &, ", and '. You can check its homepage here.</p></p>

<h2>Python (Flask)</h2>
<h3><strong>. Vulnerable code</strong></h3>
<p>Consider the following simple Flask application. Try to find the vulnerable part.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b223ac11-9fc5-4077-bd98-7fc45a255104)

<p>If you are unfamiliar with Flask, request.args.get() is used to access query string parameters from the request URL. In fact, request.args contains all the query string parameters in a dictionary-like object. For example, in http://shop.thm/search?q=table, request.args.get("q") has the value table.<br>

Because the value is taken from the user and inserted in the response HTML without sanitization or escaping, it is easy to append a malicious query. As a proof of concept, we can test the following URL: http://shop.thm/search?q=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>, and if the site is vulnerable, an alert box will appear displaying the user’s cookie.</p>

<h3><strong>. Fixed code</strong></h3>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b69c14c9-486e-415a-8ef9-d0f0df0f1ba0)

<p>The main change is that the user input is now escaped using the escape() function from the html module. Note that the html.escape() function in Flask is actually an alias for markupsafe.escape(). They both come from the Werkzeug library and serve the same purpose: escaping unsafe characters in strings. This function converts characters like <, >, ", ' to HTML escaped entities, disarming any malicious code the user has inserted.</p>


<h2>ASP.NET</h2>
<h3><strong>. Vulnerable code</strong></h3>
<p>The code snippet below is created using ASP.NET C#.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ad305df-f6f8-48c4-8601-99bd8b9fabf3)

<p>If you are unfamiliar with ASP.NET and C#, the code above uses Request.QueryString, which returns a collection of associated string keys and values. In the example above, we are interested in the value associated with the key q, and we save it in the variable userInput. Finally, the response is created by appending the userInput to another string.</p>

<h3><strong>. Fixed code</strong></h3>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c442fd87-7bd6-4705-b6fb-6249ff805819)

<p>Again, the solution lies in encoding the user input into HTML-safe strings. ASP.NET C# provides the HttpUtility.HtmlEncode() method, which converts various characters, such as <, >, and &, into their respective HTML entity encoding.</p>
