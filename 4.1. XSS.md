<h1>3. Causes and Implications</h1>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users. As a result, the unsuspecting users end up running the unauthorized script in their browsers, although the website they are visiting is trusted to be benign. Therefore, XSS can be a severe threat because it exploits usersâ€™ trust in a site.</p>

<h2>What Makes XSS Possible</h2>
<br>
<p>There are many reasons why XSS vulnerabilities are still found in web apps. Below, we list a few of them.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>Insufficient input validation and sanitization</strong></h3>
<p>Web applications accept user data, e.g., via forms, and use this data in the dynamic generation of HTML pages. Consequently, malicious scripts can be embedded as part of the legitimate input and will eventually be executed by the browser unless adequately sanitized.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>Lack of output encoding</strong></h3>
<p>The user can use various characters to alter how a web browser processes and displays a web page. For the HTML part, it is critical to properly encode characters such as <, >, ", ', and & into their respective HTML encoding. For JavaScript, special attention should be given to escape ', ", and \. Failing to encode user-supplied data correctly is a leading cause of XSS vulnerabilities.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>Improper use of security headers</strong></h3>
<p>Various security headers can help mitigate XSS vulnerabilities. For example, Content Security Policy (CSP) mitigates XSS risks by defining which sources are trusted for executable scripts. A misconfigured CSP, such as overly permissive policies or the improper use of unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval directives, can make it easier for the attacker to execute their XSS payloads.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>Framework and language vulnerabilities</strong></h3>
<p>Some older web frameworks did not provide security mechanisms against XSS; others have unpatched XSS vulnerabilities. Modern web frameworks automatically escape XSS by design and promptly patch any discovered vulnerability.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>Third-party libraries</strong></h3>
<p>Integrating third-party libraries in a web application can introduce XSS vulnerabilities; even if the core web application is not vulnerable.</p>
