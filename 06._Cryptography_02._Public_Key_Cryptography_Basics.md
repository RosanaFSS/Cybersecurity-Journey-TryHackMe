<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my <strong><em>172</em></strong>-day-streak.<br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539a017e-30c6-4aef-aebb-1cdd50cdf4a6)

<p>Consider the following scenario from everyday life. Let’s say you are meeting a business partner over coffee and discussing somewhat confidential business plans. Let’s break down the meeting from the security perspective.<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>You can see and hear the other person. Consequently, it is easy to be sure of their identity. That’s <code>authentication</code>code>, i.e., you are confirming the identity of who you are talking with.</li>
    <li>You can also confirm that what you are “hearing” is coming from your business partner. You can tell what words and sentences are coming from your business partner and what is coming from others. That’s <code>authenticity</code>, i.e., you verify that the message genuinely comes from a specific sender. Moreover, you know that what they are saying is reaching you, and there is no chance of anything changing the other party’s words across the table. That’s <code>integrity</code>, i.e., ensuring that the data has not been altered or tampered with.</li>
    <li>Finally, you can pick a seat away from the other customers and keep your voice low so that only your business partner can hear you. That’s <code>confidentiality</code>, i.e., only the authorised parties can access the data.</li>
</ul></p>

<br>
Let’s quickly compare this with correspondence in the cyber realm. When someone sends you a text message, how can you be sure they are who they claim to be? How can you be sure that nothing changed the text as it travelled across various network links? When you are communicating with your business partner over an online messaging platform, you need to be sure of the following:<br><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>Authentication</code>: You want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.</li>
    <li><code>Authenticity</code>: You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.</li>
    <li><code>Integrity</code>: You must ensure that no one changes the data you exchange</li>
    <li><code>Confidentiality</code>: You want to prevent an unauthorised party from eavesdropping on your conversations.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Cryptography can provide solutions to satisfy the above requirements, among many others. Private key cryptography, i.e., symmetric encryption, mainly protects confidentiality. However, public key cryptography, i.e., asymmetric cryptography, plays a significant role in authentication, authenticity, and integrity. This room will show various examples of how public key cryptography achieves that.</p>

<h3>Learning Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This room is the second of three introductory rooms about cryptography. Before starting this room, ensure you have finished the first one on the list.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">

<h2>Task 2 - Common Use of Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<p>Exchanging keys for symmetric encryption is a widespread use of asymmetric cryptography. Asymmetric encryption is relatively slow compared to symmetric encryption; therefore, we rely on asymmetric encryption to negotiate and agree on symmetric encryption ciphers and keys.<br>

But the question is, how do you agree on a key with the server without transmitting the key for people snooping to see?</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cc1763f-2ebe-41d0-96ea-034eb156a0c6)

<h3>Analogy</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a secret code for communicating and instructions for using the secret code. The question is how you can send these instructions to your friend without anyone else being able to read them. The answer is more straightforward than it seems; you could ask your friend for a lock. Only your friend has the key for this lock, and we’ll assume you have an indestructible box you can lock with it.<br>

If you send the instructions in a locked box to your friend, they can unlock it once it reaches them and read the instructions. After that, you can communicate using the secret code without the risk of people snooping.<br>

In this metaphor, the secret code represents a symmetric encryption cipher and key, the lock represents the server’s public key, and the key represents the server’s private key.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a788f17-c142-4956-a898-7d6f685e7394)

<p>Consequently, you would only need to use asymmetric cryptography once so that it won’t affect the speed, and then you can communicate privately using symmetric encryption.</p>

<h3>The Real World</h3>
<p>In reality, you need more cryptography to verify that the person you’re talking to is who they say they are. This is achieved using digital signatures and certificates, which we will visit later in this room.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Task 3 - RSA</h2>
<p>RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm that enables secure data transmission over insecure channels. With an insecure channel, we expect adversaries to eavesdrop on it.</p>

<h3>The Math That Makes RSA Secure</h3>
<p>RSA is based on the mathematically difficult problem of factoring a large number. Multiplying two large prime numbers is a straightforward operation; however, finding the factors of a huge number takes much more computing power.<br>

It’s simple to multiply two prime numbers together even on paper, say 113 × 127 = 14351. Even for larger prime numbers, it would still be a feasible job, even by hand. Consider the following numeric example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Prime number 1: 982451653031</li>
    <li>Prime number 2: 169743212279!</li>
    <li>Their product: 982451653031 × 169743212279 = 166764499494295486767649</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, it’s pretty tricky to determine what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 and even more challenging to find the factors of 166764499494295486767649.<br>

In real-world examples, the prime numbers would be much bigger than the ones in this example. A computer can easily factorise 166764499494295486767649; however, it cannot factorise a number with more than 600 digits. And you would agree that the multiplication of the two huge prime numbers, each around 300 digits, would be easier than the factorisation of their product.</p>

<h3>Numerical Example</h3>
<p>Let’s revisit encryption, decryption, and key usage in asymmetric encryption. The public key is known to all correspondents and is used for encryption, while the private key is protected and used for decryption, as shown in the figure below.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bcd57d8-becc-4003-a07e-7d433c2575df)

<p>In the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/cryptographybasics">Cryptography Basics</a> room, we explained the modulo operation and said it plays a significant role in cryptography. In the following simplified numerical example, we see the RSA algorithm in action:</p>
<ol type="1.  ">
  <li>Bob chooses two prime numbers: p = 157 and q = 199. He calculates n = p × q = 31243.</li>
  <li>With ϕ(n) = n − p − q + 1 = 31243 − 157 − 199 + 1 = 30888, Bob selects e = 163 such that e is relatively prime to ϕ(n); moreover, he selects d = 379, where e × d = 1 mod ϕ(n), i.e., e × d = 163 × 379 = 61777 and 61777 mod 30888 = 1. The public key is (n,e), i.e., (31243,163) and the private key is $(n,d), i.e., (31243,379).</li>
  <li>Let’s say that the value they want to encrypt is x = 13, then Alice would calculate and send y = xe mod n = 13163 mod 31243 = 16342.</li>
  <li>Bob will decrypt the received value by calculating x = yd mod n = 16341379 mod 31243 = 13. This way, Bob recovers the value that Alice sent.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>The proof that the above algorithm works can be found in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/modular-arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a> and is beyond the scope of this module. It is worth repeating that in this example, we picked a three-digit prime number, while in an actual application, p and q would be at least a 300-digit prime number each.</p>

<h3>RSA in CTFs</h3>
<p>The math behind RSA comes up relatively often in CTFs, requiring you to calculate variables or break some encryption based on them. Many good articles online explain RSA, and they will give you almost all of the information you need to complete the challenges. One good example of an RSA CTF challenge is the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/breakrsa">Breaking RSA</a> room.

There are some excellent tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs. My favourite is <a href="https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool">RsaCtfTool</a>, which has worked well for me. I’ve also had some success with <a href="https://github.com/ius/rsatool">rsatool</a>.

You need to know the main variables for RSA in CTFs: p, q, m, n, e, d, and c. As per our numerical example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are large prime numbers</li>
    <li><code>n</code> is the product of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code></li>
    <li>The public key is <code>n</code> and <code>e</code></li>
    <li>The private key is <code>n</code> and <code>d</code></li>
    <li><code>m</code> is used to represent the original message, i.e., plaintext</li>
    <li><code>c</code> represents the encrypted text, i.e., ciphertext</li>
</ul>

<p>Crypto CTF challenges often present you with a set of these values, and you need to break the encryption and decrypt a message to retrieve the flag.</p>

<h2>Task 4 - Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h2>
<p>One of the challenges of using symmetric encryption is sharing the secret key. Let’s say you want to send a password-protected document to your business partner to discuss confidential business strategies. How would you share the password with them? It would be best if you had a secure channel to send the password, knowing that adversaries cannot read or alter it.</p>

<h3>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h3>
<p><strong>Key exchange</strong> aims to establish a shared secret between two parties. It is a method that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure communication channel without requiring a pre-existing shared secret and without an observer being able to get this key. Consequently, this shared key can be used for symmetric encryption in subsequent communications.<br>

Consider the following scenario. Alice and Bob want to talk securely. They want to establish a shared key for symmetric cryptography but don’t want to use asymmetric cryptography for the key exchange. This is where the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange comes in.<br>

Alice and Bob generate secrets independently; let’s call these secrets A and B. They also have some public common material; let’s call this C.<br>

We need to make some assumptions. Firstly, whenever we combine secrets, they’re practically impossible to separate. Secondly, the order in which they’re combined doesn’t matter. Alice and Bob will combine their secrets with the common material to form AC and BC. They will then send these to each other and combine the received part with their secret to create two identical keys, both ABC. Now, they can use this key to communicate.<br>

If you found the previous paragraphs too abstract, let’s investigate the exact process.</p>

<p>||||| I'll be completing the text for this part of the THM room soon ||||</p>

<p>The chosen numbers are too small to provide any security, and in real-life applications, we would consider much bigger numbers.<br>

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is often used alongside RSA public key cryptography. Diffie-Hellman is used for key agreement, while RSA is used for digital signatures, key transport, and authentication, among many others. For instance, RSA helps prove the identity of the person you’re talking to via digital signing, as you can confirm based on their public key. This would prevent someone from attacking the connection with a man-in-the-middle attack against Alice by pretending to be Bob. In brief, Diffie-Hellman and RSA are incorporated into many security protocols and standards to provide a comprehensive security solution.</p>

<h2>Task 7 - PGP and GPG</h2>
<p><code>PGP</code> stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It’s software that implements encryption for encrypting files, performing digital signing, and more. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">GnuPG or GPGosana</a> is an open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard.<br>

GPG is commonly used in email to protect the confidentiality of the email messages. Furthermore, it can be used to sign an email message and confirm its integrity.<br>

Below is an example of generating GPG. You are asked about the purpose of using <code>gpg</code>, whether signing only or signing and encrypting. Besides selecting the cryptographic algorithm, we needed to choose an expiry date for the generated key. Finally, we provided some information about us: our name, email address, and a comment usually about the purpose of this key.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e304f0a5-a27d-431e-b2dd-23d6157d848c)

<p>You may need to use GPG to decrypt files in CTFs. With PGP/GPG, private keys can be protected with passphrases in a similar way that we protect SSH private keys. If the key is passphrase protected, you can attempt to crack it using John the Ripper and <code>gpg2john</code>. The key provided in this task is not protected with a passphrase. The man page for GPG can be found online here.

<h3>Practi﻿cal Example</h3>

<p>Now that you have your GPG key pair, you can share the public key with your contacts. Whenever your contacts want to communicate securely, they encrypt their messages to you using your public key. To decrypt the message, you will have to use your private key. Due to the importance of the GPG keys, it is vital that you keep a backup copy in a secure location.<br>

Let’s say you got a new computer. All you need to do is import your key, and you can start decrypting your received messages again:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>You would use <code>gpg --import backup.key</code> to import your key from backup.key.</li>
    <li>To decrypt your messages, you need to issue <code>gpg --decrypt confidential_message.gpg</code>code></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Task 8 - Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have defined <code>cryptography</code> as the science of securing communication in the presence of adversaries. Another important science that studies how to break or bypass cryptographic systems is <code>cryptanalysis</code>. As for trying every possible password combination, we call that a <code>brute-force attack</code>. However, when we know that the password is most likely a dictionary word, it will make more sense to try words from a dictionary instead of every possible password combination; this is called a <code>dictionary</code> attack.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>Cryptography</code> is the science of securing communication and data using codes and ciphers.</li>
    <li><code>Cryptanalysis</code> is the study of methods to break or bypass cryptographic security systems without knowing the key.: You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.</li>
    <li><code>Brute-Force Attack</code> is an attack method that involves trying every possible key or password to decrypt a message.</li>
    <li><code>Dictionary Attack</code>: is an attack method where the attacker tries dictionary words or combinations of them.</li>
