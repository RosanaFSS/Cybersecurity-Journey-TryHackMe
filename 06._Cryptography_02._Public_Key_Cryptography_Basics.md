<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my <strong><em>172</em></strong>-day-streak.<br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539a017e-30c6-4aef-aebb-1cdd50cdf4a6)

<p>Consider the following scenario from everyday life. Let’s say you are meeting a business partner over coffee and discussing somewhat confidential business plans. Let’s break down the meeting from the security perspective.<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>You can see and hear the other person. Consequently, it is easy to be sure of their identity. That’s <code>authentication</code>code>, i.e., you are confirming the identity of who you are talking with.</li>
    <li>You can also confirm that what you are “hearing” is coming from your business partner. You can tell what words and sentences are coming from your business partner and what is coming from others. That’s <code>authenticity</code>, i.e., you verify that the message genuinely comes from a specific sender. Moreover, you know that what they are saying is reaching you, and there is no chance of anything changing the other party’s words across the table. That’s <code>integrity</code>, i.e., ensuring that the data has not been altered or tampered with.</li>
    <li>Finally, you can pick a seat away from the other customers and keep your voice low so that only your business partner can hear you. That’s <code>confidentiality</code>, i.e., only the authorised parties can access the data.</li>
</ul></p>

<br>
Let’s quickly compare this with correspondence in the cyber realm. When someone sends you a text message, how can you be sure they are who they claim to be? How can you be sure that nothing changed the text as it travelled across various network links? When you are communicating with your business partner over an online messaging platform, you need to be sure of the following:<br><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>Authentication</code>: You want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.</li>
    <li><code>Authenticity</code>: You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.</li>
    <li><code>Integrity</code>: You must ensure that no one changes the data you exchange</li>
    <li><code>Confidentiality</code>: You want to prevent an unauthorised party from eavesdropping on your conversations.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Cryptography can provide solutions to satisfy the above requirements, among many others. Private key cryptography, i.e., symmetric encryption, mainly protects confidentiality. However, public key cryptography, i.e., asymmetric cryptography, plays a significant role in authentication, authenticity, and integrity. This room will show various examples of how public key cryptography achieves that.</p>

<h3>Learning Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This room is the second of three introductory rooms about cryptography. Before starting this room, ensure you have finished the first one on the list.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/cryptographybasics">Cryptography Basics</a></li>
    <li>Public Key Cryptography Basics (this room)</li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/hashingbasics">Hashing Basics</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>In this room, we will cover various asymmetric cryptosystems and applications that use them, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>RSA</li>
    <li>Diffie-Hellman</li>
    <li>SSH</li>
    <li>SSL/TLS Certificates</li>
    <li>PGP and GPG</li>
</ul>

<p>First, let’s start the <code>Virtual Machine</code> by pressing the <code>Start Machine</code> button below.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca86d15e-a4d4-4015-8597-22bb6fa5cf3c)

<p>The machine will start in <code>Split-Screen</code> view. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue <code>Show Split View</code> button at the top of the page.<br>

You can also access the virtual machine using SSH at the IP address <code>10.10.106.141</code> using the following credentials:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Username: user</li>
    <li>Password: Tryhackme123!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task 2 - RSA</h2>
<p>RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm that enables secure data transmission over insecure channels. With an insecure channel, we expect adversaries to eavesdrop on it.</p>

<h3>The Math That Makes RSA Secure</h3>
<p>RSA is based on the mathematically difficult problem of factoring a large number. Multiplying two large prime numbers is a straightforward operation; however, finding the factors of a huge number takes much more computing power.<br>

It’s simple to multiply two prime numbers together even on paper, say 113 × 127 = 14351. Even for larger prime numbers, it would still be a feasible job, even by hand. Consider the following numeric example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Prime number 1: 982451653031</li>
    <li>Prime number 2: 169743212279!</li>
    <li>Their product: 982451653031 × 169743212279 = 166764499494295486767649</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, it’s pretty tricky to determine what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 and even more challenging to find the factors of 166764499494295486767649.<br>

In real-world examples, the prime numbers would be much bigger than the ones in this example. A computer can easily factorise 166764499494295486767649; however, it cannot factorise a number with more than 600 digits. And you would agree that the multiplication of the two huge prime numbers, each around 300 digits, would be easier than the factorisation of their product.</p>

<h3>Numerical Example</h3>
<p>Let’s revisit encryption, decryption, and key usage in asymmetric encryption. The public key is known to all correspondents and is used for encryption, while the private key is protected and used for decryption, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/cryptographybasics">Cryptography Basics</a> room, we explained the modulo operation and said it plays a significant role in cryptography. In the following simplified numerical example, we see the RSA algorithm in action:</p>
