<h5 align="center"><em>Mayor Malware was scheming, quite full of delight,<br>
To ruin SOC-mas and frighten SOC teams.<br>
But Glitch and McSkidy had spoiled his plan,<br>
By uncovering secrets that exposed the man!.</em></h5>

<p>Mayor Malware slammed his hand on the table, his eyes narrowing as the report flashed on his screen. Glitch and McSkidy had uncovered his trail. He took a deep breath, calming himself. "No matter," he muttered, a sinister grin forming. "They may have found me but haven't stopped me." His confidence stemmed from the malware he had craftedâ€”so devious and advanced that it would easily evade detection.<br>

But before unleashing it to wreak havoc on SOC teams and ruin SOC-mas, there was one final step. He needed to test it in a sandbox.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>While it might seem like using the SOC superpower makes things super easy, that is not always the case. There are cases which can act as Kryptonite to the SOC superpower
    
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Analyze malware behaviour using sandbox tools.</li>
    <li>Explore how to use YARA rules to detect malicious patterns.</li>
    <li>Learn about various malware evasion techniques.</li>
    <li>Implement an evasion technique to bypass YARA rule detection.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><strong>Connecting to the Machine</strong></h3>

<p>Before moving forward, review the questions in the connection card below:</p>

<p>Click on the green <code>Start Machine</code> button  to start the virtual machine in split-screen view.</p>

<p><code>Start Machine</code></p>

<p>If the VM is not visible, use the blue <code>Show Split View</code> button  at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can connect to the VM via Remote Desktop (RDP) using the credentials below:</p>

<p>He clenched his fist, a determined glint in his eye. "Just a little more fine-tuning," he murmured. He would study, adapt, and evolve his malware until it was truly undetectable. When the time was right, he would unleash it upon the unsuspecting SOC teams, striking when they least expected it.<br>

But for now, he would wait. Watching. Planning. And he was perfecting his craft in the shadows.</p>
