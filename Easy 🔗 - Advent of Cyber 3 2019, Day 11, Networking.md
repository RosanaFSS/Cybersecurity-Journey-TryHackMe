McDatabaseAdmin came rushing into the room and cried to McSkidy, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been locked out of the reindeer schedule - how will Santa‚Äôs transportation work for Christmas?‚Äù The grinch has locked McDatabaseAdmin of his system. You need to probe the external surface of the server to see if you get him his access back.<br>

MS SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). One simple way to think of a relational database is a group of tables that have relations. To gain a rough understanding of relational databases work, consider a shop's database with the following three tables:<br>

- Electronic Items<br>
- Customers<br>
- Invoices<br><br>

Each item in the Electronic Items table has:

ID
Name
Price
Quantity
Each item in the Customers table has its own attributes as well:

ID
Name
Email
Phone
Finally, the Invoices table will refer to a customer and one or more electronic items. The Invoice table will refer to an ‚Äúentity‚Äù from another table using its ID. This way, we only need to have the customer details and electronic item details written once instead of copying them to each new invoice. This case is a simplified example of a relational database. The figure below shows how the three tables are related.</p>
