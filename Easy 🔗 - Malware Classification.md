<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<p>Malware refers to software or code created to damage systems, steal information, or allow unauthorised access. It appears in many forms, each with different tactics and goals. Malware can affect businesses in many ways, from financial loss and stolen data to disrupted services and reputational damage. Knowing how malware works is one of the first steps in defending against it.<br>

SOC analysts are responsible for spotting and responding to suspicious activity. They review security alerts and decide what action to take based on the type of threat involved. Classifying malware correctly helps determine the correct response, such as isolating infected machines or investigating data theft. This room introduces the most common malware categories, explains how to tell them apart, and includes real-world examples to support learning.<br>

We'll cover key categories of malware, real-world examples, and the differences between binary and script-based threats.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>

- Learn to classify common malware types based on their behaviour and purpose.<br>
- Understand how real-world malware operates.<br>

<h2>Task 2 . Malware Types</h2>
<p>Knowing the main types of malware and how they behave helps analysts spot threats quickly. Malware is not just a single thing; it comes in different categories, each with a specific purpose and attack method. By learning to identify these, teams can better respond to incidents and keep their environments safer.</p>

<h3>Malware Categories</h3>
<p>Below is a table summarising the most common malware categories, their main purpose, typical behaviour, and a real-world example for each. Some practical, scenario-based examples follow this to show how these types of malware appear in everyday incidents.</p>

<h2>Task 3 . Real-World Malware Examples</h2>
<p>Malware is not just a concept found in textbooks. Security teams deal with malware categories like spyware, ransomware, wipers, data stealers, keyloggers, and remote access trojans (RATs) in real incidents. Seeing how each type appears in actual attacks helps contextualise the theory and make the patterns easier to remember. We often refer to malware that relates to or is similar to each other as part of the same malware family.<br>

A malware family refers to a group of malicious programs that share the same origin or codebase and behave similarly. Grouping malware like this helps security teams apply known defences and improve detection and response. Below are short case studies for known malware and links to learn more.</p>

<h3>C2 RAT Malware</h3>
<h6>Case Study, <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/hibernating-qakbot-comprehensive-study-and-depth-campaign-analysis">Qakot</a>:</h6>

<p>QakBot, also known as QBot, has become one of the most active and dangerous malware families targeting organisations globally. Originally designed as a banking trojan, QakBot has evolved into a modular RAT used by cybercriminal groups for initial access, credential theft, and as a loader for ransomware like Black Basta. QakBot typically arrives through phishing emails with malicious attachments or links. Once inside a network, it establishes a connection to its command-and-control servers, enabling attackers to move laterally, steal data, or deploy additional malware. In 2023, QakBot was responsible for several high-profile incidents, and law enforcement agencies have issued warnings about its continued activity.</p>
