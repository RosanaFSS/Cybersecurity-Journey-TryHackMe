<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>

<p>In the previous few rooms, we learned about performing forensics on Windows machines. While Windows is still the most common Desktop Operating System, especially in enterprise environments, Linux also constitutes a significant portion of the pie. Especially, Linux is very common in servers that host different services for enterprises. 

<h3>LearningObjectives</h3>

<p>After completing this room, we will have learned:<br>

<p>. An introduction to Linux and its different flavors.<br>
.  Finding OS, account, and system information on a Linux machine.<br>
.  Finding information about running processes, executed processes, and processes that are scheduled to run.<br>
.  Finding system log files and identifying information from them.<br>
.  Common third-party applications used in Linux and their logs</p>

<h2>Task 2 . Linux Forensics</h2>

<p>The Linux Operating System can be found in a lot of places. While it might not be as easy to use as Windows or macOS, it has its own set of advantages that make its use widespread. It is found in the Web servers you interact with, in your smartphone, and maybe, even in the entertainment unit of your car. One of the reasons for this versatility is that Linux is an open-source Operating System with many different flavors. It is also very lightweight and can run on very low resources. It can be considered modular in nature and can be customized as per requirements, meaning that only those components can be installed which are required. All of these reasons make Linux an important part of our lives.<br>

For learning more about Linux, it is highly recommended that you go through the Linux Fundamentals 1, Linux Fundamentals 2, and Linux Fundamentals 3 rooms on TryHackMe.</p>

<h3>Linux Distributions</h3>
<p>Linux comes in many different flavors, also called distributions. There are minor differences between these distributions. Sometimes the differences are mostly cosmetic, while sometimes the differences are a little more pronounced. Some of the common Linux distributions include::<br>

<p>. An introduction to Linux and its different flavors.<br>
.  Ubuntu<br>
.  Redhat<br>
.  ArchLinux<br>
.  Open SUSE<br>
.  Linux Mint<br>
.  CentOS<br>
.  Debian</p>

<p>For the purpose of this room, we will be working on the Ubuntu distribution. So let's move on to the next task to learn to perform forensics on Linux.</p>
