<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 174-day-streak.<br>Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>
<p>CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a <code>Swiss Army Knife</code> for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like <code>XOR</code> or <code>Base64</code> to complex operations like <code>AES encryption</code> or <code>RSA decryption</code>. CyberChef operates on <code>recipes</code>, a series of operations executed in order.</p>

<h2>Task 6 - Your First Official Cook</h2>

<p>This task allows us to apply what we've learned from the previous tasks. We'll utilize CyberChef's areas and its features to answer the questions being asked. <br>

Now, this is the time that you truly shine! You are going for your first cook ever!</p>

<p>Ready? Let's get our hands dirty, then!<br>

Note: It's best to try to answer the questions first without using the hints.</p>

<h2>Task 7 - Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this room, we discussed how CyberChef is a powerful tool for handling various data transformations and decoding tasks. Whether you need to work with Base64, Binary, or URLs, this digital wizard's kitchen provides a visual interface that makes data manipulation intuitive and straightforward. With a diverse recipe library, you can confidently tackle tasks ranging from extracting email addresses, IP addresses, and domains. We were able to navigate its interface and have a high-level discussion of the different areas, features, and parameters. However, note that for particularly large-scale processing, it's vital to benefit from support from other tools.</p>
