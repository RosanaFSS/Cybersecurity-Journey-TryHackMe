<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 29-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/exploitingavulnerabilityv2">Exploit Vulnerabilities</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>In this room, we are going to be going over some means of identifying vulnerabilities and coupling our research skills to learn how these can be abused.<br>

Additionally, you will find some publicly available resources that are essential additions to your skill set and tools when performing vulnerability research and exploitation. You will then get to apply all of this into a practical challenge at the end of the room.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Service Detection</h2>

<p>There is a myriad of tools and services available in cybersecurity for vulnerability scanning. Ranging from being commercial (and footing a heavy bill) to open-source and free, vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws.</p>

<p>For example, the vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands of pounds for a year's license will likely be used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits. If you’d like to know more about Nessus, check out the TryHackMe room dedicated to it.<br>

I have detailed some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner in the table below:</p>

<p>Frameworks such as Metasploit often have vulnerability scanners for some modules; this is something you will come onto learn about in a further module in this pathway.<br>

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.<br>

Ultimately, both techniques involve testing an application or program for vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include:</p>

<p>If you are keen to learn more about these vulnerabilities, the OWASP framework will be a useful read to you. TryHackMe even has a room showcasing the top ten vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP.</p>
<br>

> 2.1 - <em>You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay).</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.2 - <em>You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.3 - <em>You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?</em><br>

<h2>Task 3 - Finding Manual Exploits</h2>

<h2>Task 4 - Example of Manual Exploitation</h2>

<h2>Task 5 - Practical: Manual Exploitation</h2>

<h2>Room Complete</h2>














<p>This room is the last in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In this room, we focus on the steps that follow port-scanning: in particular, service detection, OS detection, Nmap scripting engine, and saving the scan results.<br>
<ol type="1. ">
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap01">Nmap Live Host Discover</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap02">Nmap Basic Port Scans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap03">Nmap Advanced Port Scans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap04">Nmap Post Port Scans</a></li>
</ol></p>
<p>In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.<br><br>
In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:</p>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)</li>
  <li>Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)</li>
  <li>Run Nmap’s traceroute</li>
  <li>Run select Nmap scripts</li>
  <li>Save the scan results in various formats</li>
</ol></p>

<p>This room will focus on these steps and how to execute them after the port scan.</p>

> 1.1 - <em>Ensure you have a solid understanding of how the Nmap scan progresses and the steps and stages it follows. Launch the AttackBox by using the Start AttackBox button, as you will need it to answer the questions in later tasks.</em><br>
