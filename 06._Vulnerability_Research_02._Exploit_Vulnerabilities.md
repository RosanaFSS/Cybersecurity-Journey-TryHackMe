<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 29-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/exploitingavulnerabilityv2">Exploit Vulnerabilities</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>In this room, we are going to be going over some means of identifying vulnerabilities and coupling our research skills to learn how these can be abused.<br>

Additionally, you will find some publicly available resources that are essential additions to your skill set and tools when performing vulnerability research and exploitation. You will then get to apply all of this into a practical challenge at the end of the room.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Service Detection</h2>

<p>There is a myriad of tools and services available in cybersecurity for vulnerability scanning. Ranging from being commercial (and footing a heavy bill) to open-source and free, vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws.</p>

<p>For example, the vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands of pounds for a year's license will likely be used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits. If you’d like to know more about Nessus, check out the TryHackMe room dedicated to it.<br>

I have detailed some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner in the table below:</p>

<p>Frameworks such as Metasploit often have vulnerability scanners for some modules; this is something you will come onto learn about in a further module in this pathway.<br>

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.<br>

Ultimately, both techniques involve testing an application or program for vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include:</p>

<p>If you are keen to learn more about these vulnerabilities, the OWASP framework will be a useful read to you. TryHackMe even has a room showcasing the top ten vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP.</p>
<br>

> 2.1 - <em>You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay).</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.2 - <em>You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.3 - <em>You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
