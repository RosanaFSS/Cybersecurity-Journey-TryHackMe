<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 29-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/exploitingavulnerabilityv2">Exploit Vulnerabilities</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>In this room, we are going to be going over some means of identifying vulnerabilities and coupling our research skills to learn how these can be abused.<br>

Additionally, you will find some publicly available resources that are essential additions to your skill set and tools when performing vulnerability research and exploitation. You will then get to apply all of this into a practical challenge at the end of the room.</p>

> 1.1 - <em>Let's proceed.</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>

<h2>Task 2 - Service Detection</h2>

<p>There is a myriad of tools and services available in cybersecurity for vulnerability scanning. Ranging from being commercial (and footing a heavy bill) to open-source and free, vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws.</p>

<p>For example, the vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands of pounds for a year's license will likely be used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits. If you’d like to know more about Nessus, check out the TryHackMe room dedicated to it.<br>

I have detailed some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner in the table below:</p>

<p>Frameworks such as Metasploit often have vulnerability scanners for some modules; this is something you will come onto learn about in a further module in this pathway.<br>

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.<br>

Ultimately, both techniques involve testing an application or program for vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include:</p>

<p>If you are keen to learn more about these vulnerabilities, the OWASP framework will be a useful read to you. TryHackMe even has a room showcasing the top ten vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP.</p>
<br>

> 2.1 - <em>You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay).</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Yay</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.2 - <em>You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Injection</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.3 - <em>You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Broken Access Control</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>


<h2>Task 3 - Finding Manual Exploits</h2>
<br>

<h3>Rapid7</h3>
<p>Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).</p>

<p>Additionally, the database contains instructions for exploiting applications using the popular Metasploit tool (you will learn about this tool in-depth later in the learning path). For example, this entry on Rapid7 is for “Wordpress Plugin SP Project & Document”, where we can see instructions on how to use an exploit module to abuse this vulnerability.

<h3>Github</h3>
<p>GitHub is a popular web service designed for software developers. The site is used to host and share the source code of applications to allow a collaborative effort. However, security researchers have taken to this platform because of the aforementioned reasons as well. Security researchers store & share PoC’s (Proof of Concept) on GitHub, turning it into an exploit database in this context.<br>

GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload – there is no formal verification process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that said, there is also a downside in that PoC’s may not work where little to no support will be provided.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21999229-8fe7-4651-a3b6-b6c540194e14)

<p>GitHub uses a tagging and keyword system, meaning that we can search GitHub by keywords such as “PoC”, “vulnerability”, and many more. At the time of writing, there are 9,682 repositories with the keyword “cve”. We are also able to filter the results by programming language.</p>

<h3>Searchsploit</h3>
<p>Searchsploit is a tool that is available on popular pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux. It is also available on the TryHackMe AttackBox. This tool is an offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on your system.<br>

You are able to search searchsploit by application name and/or vulnerability type. For example, in the snippet below, we are searching searchsploit for exploits relating to Wordpress that we can use – no downloading necessary!</p>

<br>

> 3.1 - <em>What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Github</stron></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 3.2 - <em>You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Searchsploit</strong></code><br>
