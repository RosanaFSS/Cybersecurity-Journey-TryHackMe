<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s key part of my 175-day-streak.<br>Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/monikerlink">Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)</a>.<br>
<code>Note</code>: only subscribers can deploy Virtual Machines in this room.</p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>FlareVM</strong>, or "<strong>Forensics, Logic Analysis, and Reverse Engineering,</strong>strong>" stands out as a comprehensive and carefully curated collection of specialized tools uniquely designed to meet the specific needs of reverse engineers, malware analysts, incident responders, forensic investigators, and penetration testers. This toolkit, expertly crafted by the FLARE Team at FireEye, is a powerful aid in unravelling digital mysteries, gaining insight into malware behaviour, and delving into the complex details within executables. </p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Explore tools inside the FlareVM.</li>
    <li>Learn how to use tools to analyze potentially malicious processes effectively.</li>
    <li>Be familiar with the tools used for static analysis of malicious documents and binaries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Room Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This room expects that you are familiar with various technical terms related to Windows and processes. If you are unfamiliar with these terms, please consider joining the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/path/outline/presecurity">Pre Security</a> path.</p>

<h3>RVM Access</h3>
<p>Getting your hands on this tool can be pretty daunting at first, as building it starting from scratch takes a lot of time, and the installation will take several hours! Thankfully, we have already included this machine in this room.<br>

Click on the <strong>Start Machine</strong> button below. This should initialize an instance on FlareVM.</p>

<br>
<p>We will use the tool inside the machine attached to this task. The machine will start in a split-screen view. If you opt to access the machine via Remote Desktop (RDP), you may also use the following credentials below.</p>

<p>Almost all the files we will use in this room are located in the <code>C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Sample</code> folder.<br>

<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The FlareVM machine attached to this room contains malicious sample files as part of the practical exercises and has no internet access. These files should not be downloaded, executed (outside the FlareVM machine), or distributed under any circumstances. Doing so could potentially harm your system or network. Always handle such files only in isolated, controlled, and secure environments.</p>
