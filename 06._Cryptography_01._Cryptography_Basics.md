<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered how to prevent third parties from reading your messages? How can your app or web browser build a secure channel with a remote server? By secure, we mean that no one can read or alter the exchanged data; furthermore, we can be confident that we are connecting with the real server. Thanks to cryptography, these requirements are satisfied.<br>

Cryptography lays the foundation for our digital world. While networking protocols have made it possible for devices spread across the globe to communicate, cryptography has made it possible to trust this communication.<br>

This room is the first of three introductory rooms about cryptography. There are no learning prerequisites except basic abilities to use the Linux command line. If you are not sure, please consider joining the Pre Security path.</p>
