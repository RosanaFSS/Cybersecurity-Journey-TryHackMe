<h2>Task 1 . Seine Imcident</h2>

<p>Something audacious unfolded beneath the glass pyramid.<br>

In the early hours, a crew in hi-vis vests breached the Galerie d'Apollon inside the Louvre. Security feeds went dark, and seven minutes later, the team disappeared toward the river.<br>

You are the first analyst on call. Your mission is to reconstruct the details of the heist using open-source intelligence and online reports. The museum is under pressure, international alerts are spreading, and the press is already digging for answers.<br>

Gather and verify information from public sources: museum pages, heritage archives, news coverage, social media, and open databases.<br>

<h2>Task 2 . Louvre Protocol</h2>
<h3>Set up your virtual environment</h3>
<p>To successfully complete this room, you'll need to set up your virtual environment. This involves starting both your AttackBox (if you're not using your VPN) and Target Machines, ensuring you're equipped with the necessary tools and access to tackle the challenges ahead.</p>

<p>A recent news report referencing an earlier audit of the museum’s surveillance network revealed serious weaknesses: outdated servers, inconsistent camera coverage, and a weak password policy. As the on-call CCTV analyst, your job is to verify whether the credential clues in those reports are valid against the system and then use them to review the footage from the day of the incident, documenting every step and source.<br>

You may refer to online sources to identify the correct credential pair for this lab environment and review the footage from the day of the incident.<br>
