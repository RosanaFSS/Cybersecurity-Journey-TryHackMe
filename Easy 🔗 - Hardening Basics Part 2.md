<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to Part 2 of Hardening Basics! While this room can be enjoyed on its own, it is meant to be done in conjunction with Part 1. If you have not done Part 1 yet, I highly recommend you do so.<br><br>

In this room, we will cover the following:<br>

1. SSH and Encryption (Chapter 3)<br>
2. Mandatory Access Control (Chapter 4)<br><br>
This was mentioned in Part 1 but in case you did not do that room:<br><br>

There are no questions related to performing tasks on a virtual machine. However, I have provided a semi-configured Ubuntu 18.04 environment for you to play around with while you go through the different tasks. Things that have been configured at a basic level will be:<br>

- Users<br>
- PAM<br>
- Permissions<br>
- Passwords<br><br>

And that's it! I'll leave you to play around as you wish. You may access the machine with the following credentials (if you're coming from Part 1, you do not need to deploy the VM):<br>
<code>spooky:tryhackme</code><br><br>
These will be global credentials that should give you access to do everything you need to.  I will provide other credentials for tasks where I feel it's possible to lock yourself out from a mistake. You can find some optional challenges in Task 15. <br><br>

The hope is that by the end of this room, you'll be able to clearly explain and understand the above topics and apply them to your daily life, or life at work. Whether you're a senior systems administrator or just starting out as a junior, these topics will help you understand what it takes to harden a Linux system.<br><br>

Topics have been chosen from this book. I looked through the table of contents and picked out the ones that would be the most important and allow the room to have the best content while still keeping it within the proper limits. I think the above 4 topics are the best and will give you the most knowledge on how to harden a system. If you have a subscription to O'Reilly through work or school, I suggest checking the book out.</p>
