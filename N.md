<h2>WPA</h2>
- <code>WPA</code> stands for <code>W</code>i-Fi <code>P</code>rotected <code>A</code>ccess.<br>
- <code>WPA</code> is a security standard for computing devices equipped with wireless internet connections.<br>
- The Wi-Fi Alliance intended <code>WPA</code> as an intermediate measure to take the place of <code>WEP</code>.<br>
- <code>WEP</code> = <code>W</code>ierd <code>E</code>quivalent <code>P</code>rivacy was shown to be insecure and can be broken by capturing enough packets to guess the key via statistical methods.<br>
- <code>WPA2</code> replaced<code> WPA</code>.<br>
- <code>WEP</code>, <code>WPA</code>, <code>WPA2</code>, and the latest <code>WPA3</code> are the four types of wireless network security protocols, each with increasing levels of security.<br>

<br>
<h2>WPA2</h2>
- The <code>core of WPA2</code> authentication is the <code>4 way handshake</code>.<br>
- Most home WiFi networks, and many others, use <code>WPA2 personal</code>.<br>
- If you have to <code>log in with a password</code> and it's not WEP, then it's <code>WPA2 personal</code> = <code>WPA2-EAP</code>.<br>
- <code>WPA2-EAP</code> uses RADIUS servers to authenticate, so if you have to enter a username and password in order to connect then it's probably that.<br>
- The minimum lenght of <code>WPA2-EAP</code> OR  <code>WPA2 Personal Password</code> is 8.<br>
- You can perform <code>brute force</code>attack on the encryption on <code>WPA2 personal</code>.<br>
- <code>Brute force</code> can not be used to attack <code>WPA2-EAP</code> handshakes. <br><br>

<br>
<h2>WPA2-PSK</h2>
- <code>WPA2-PSK</code> refer to Wifis network that you connect to by providing a password that's the same for everyone.
- It refers to the <em>wifi code/ password/ passphrase</em><br>.
