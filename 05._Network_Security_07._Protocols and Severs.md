<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 26-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program. Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/protocolsandservers">Protocols and Servers</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>This room is the last in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In this room, we focus on the steps that follow port-scanning: in particular, service detection, OS detection, Nmap scripting engine, and saving the scan results.<br>
<ol type="1. ">
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap01">Nmap Live Host Discover</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap02">Nmap Basic Port Scans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap03">Nmap Advanced Port Scans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap04">Nmap Post Port Scans</a></li>
</ol></p>
<p>In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.<br><br>
In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:</p>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)</li>
  <li>Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)</li>
  <li>Run Nmap’s traceroute</li>
  <li>Run select Nmap scripts</li>
  <li>Save the scan results in various formats</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Each task about each protocol will be designed to help us understand what happens on the low level and is usually hidden by an elegant GUI (Graphical User Interface). We will “talk” using the above protocols using a simple Telnet client to fully understand what your GUI client is doing under the hood. Our purpose is not to memorize the protocol commands but rather to get a closer look at the protocol while it is working.<br><br>

We also discuss some of the insecurities. In particular, we focus on passwords sent in cleartext.</p>

> 1.1 - <em>We suggest that you start the AttackBox and the virtual machine as you proceed to tackle the following tasks. You can connect to the different services over Telnet for better practice and learning experience.</em><br>
