<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 26-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program. Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/protocolsandservers">Protocols and Servers</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>This room introduces the user to a few protocols commonly used, such as:</p>




<p>Each task about each protocol will be designed to help us understand what happens on the low level and is usually hidden by an elegant GUI (Graphical User Interface). We will “talk” using the above protocols using a simple Telnet client to fully understand what your GUI client is doing under the hood. Our purpose is not to memorize the protocol commands but rather to get a closer look at the protocol while it is working.<br><br>

We also discuss some of the insecurities. In particular, we focus on passwords sent in cleartext.</p>

> 1.1 - <em>We suggest that you start the AttackBox and the virtual machine as you proceed to tackle the following tasks. You can connect to the different services over Telnet for better practice and learning experience.</em><br>
