<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 26-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program. Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/protocolsandservers">Protocols and Servers</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>This room introduces the user to a few protocols commonly used, such as:<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>HTTP</li>
    <li>FTP</li>
    <li>POP3</li>
    <li>SMTP</li>
    <li>IMAP</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Each task about each protocol will be designed to help us understand what happens on the low level and is usually hidden by an elegant GUI (Graphical User Interface). We will “talk” using the above protocols using a simple Telnet client to fully understand what your GUI client is doing under the hood. Our purpose is not to memorize the protocol commands but rather to get a closer look at the protocol while it is working.<br>

We also discuss some of the insecurities. In particular, we focus on passwords sent in cleartext.</p>

> 1.1 - <em>We suggest that you start the AttackBox and the virtual machine as you proceed to tackle the following tasks. You can connect to the different services over Telnet for better practice and learning experience.</em><br>
>> <strong>No answer needed</strong><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 2 - Telnet</h2>

<p>The Telnet protocol is an application layer protocol used to connect to a virtual terminal of another computer. Using Telnet, a user can log into another computer and access its terminal (console) to run programs, start batch processes, and perform system administration tasks remotely.<br>

Telnet protocol is relatively simple. When a user connects, they will be asked for a username and password. Upon correct authentication, the user will access the remote system’s terminal. Unfortunately, all this communication between the Telnet client and the Telnet server is not encrypted, making it an easy target for attackers.<br>

A Telnet server uses the Telnet protocol to listen for incoming connections on port 23. (Please note that the Telnet port is not open on the target VM.) Let’s consider the example shown below. A user is connecting to the telnetd, a Telnet server. The steps are as follows:<br>

<ol type="1. ">
  <li>First, he is asked to provide his login name (username). We can see the user entering <code>frank</code>code>.</li>
  <li>Then, he is asked for the password, <code>D2xc9CgD</code>. The password is not shown on the screen; however, we display it below for demonstration purposes.</li>
  <li>Once the system checks his login credentials, he is greeted with a welcome message.</li>
  <li>And the remote server grants him a command prompt, frank@bento:~$. The $ indicates that this is not a root terminal.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Although Telnet gave us access to the remote system’s terminal in no time, it is not a reliable protocol for remote administration as all the data are sent in cleartext. In the figure below, we captured the traffic generated by Telnet, and it was so easy to find the password. The figure below shows the ASCII data exchanged between our computer and the remote system. The text in red is the text that we are sending to the remote system, while the text in blue is the text that the remote system is sending. Notice how the user name was sent back (echoed at us to display them in our terminal); however, the password was not. In other words, if someone is watching us type, they won’t be able to see the password characters on the screen.</p>

<p>Telnet is no longer considered a secure option, especially that anyone capturing your network traffic will be able to discover your usernames and passwords, which would grant them access to the remote system. The secure alternative is SSH, which we present in the next room.</p>
