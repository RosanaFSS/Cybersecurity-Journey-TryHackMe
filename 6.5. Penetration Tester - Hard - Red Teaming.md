<h2>3.  Post Compromise</h2>
<p>Learn about the steps taken by an attacker right after gaining an initial foothold on a network.</p>


<h2>4.  Host Evasions</h2>
<p>Understand the techniques behind host-based security and bypass the most common security products in Windows operating systems.</p>




<h2>5.  Network Security Evasion</h2>
<p>Learn how to bypass and evade different security solutions used in the industry, such as firewalls and IDS/IPS.</p>



<h2>6.  Compromising Active Directory</h2>
<p>Learn and exploit Active Directory networks through core security issues stemming from misconfigurations..</p>
