May 27, 2025<br> Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m excited to join you on this adventure, part of my $$\textcolor{#FF69B4}{\textbf{386}}$$-day-streak in  <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a><br>
Creating custom tooling for application testing using Burp Plugins. Access it clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/customtoolingviaburp"</a>here.<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>

<p>The ability to create your own custom tooling is critically important for web application red teaming. Rarely will you be able to find a tool or plugin that will do exactly what you need. This then calls for you to develop custom tooling! This custom tooling module will showcase different ways you can approach this problem. Each option is unique and has its benefits and drawbacks.

<br>
<br>
In this room, we will focus on using Burp plugins to create tools and exploit them. Burp acts as an intercepting proxy, allowing you to view and modify requests and responses as the web application interfaces with it. Burp has several features, such as repeating requests or performing automated brute forcing of specific requests and payloads. This makes plugins a unique option when you need additional versatility in your tooling to be used in an automated and manual fashion. While we will showcase using Burp plugins in this room, the principles can be applied to any intercepting proxy you choose. Let's dive in and use Burp plugins to create our very own custom tools and exploits!</p>

<h2>Task 3 . Using Extensions in Burp</h2>
<p>In this task, we will explore Burp extensions and how they ease a pentester’s job by automating routine tasks. Burp offers built-in extensions that enhance basic security testing capabilities, such as logging, request/response modification, and simple automation. Some of the extensions are available for free, while a few require Burp Professional.</p>
<h3>Playing with Extensions</h3>
<p>In the attached VM, click on the Burp icon on the left pane to open the Burp Sutie Community Edition. Once Burp is open, click on the Extension tab and then click on the BApp Store to view multiple extensions offered by Burp and uploaded by community users worldwide. </p>
