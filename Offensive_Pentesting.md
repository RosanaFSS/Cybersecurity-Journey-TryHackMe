##### Type: Easy
##### Link: https://tryhackme.com/r/room/powershell
##### Goals: understand what is Powershell, learn basic Powershell commands, develop Windows enumeration skills, and learn Powershell scripting
<br>
<br>
- Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the .NET framework.
- Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in .NET.
- Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat object-oriented.
