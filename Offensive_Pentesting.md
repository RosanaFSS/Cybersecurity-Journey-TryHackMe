<br>
<p> - Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the .NET framework. <br>
- Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in .NET.<br>
- Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat object-oriented.<br>
- This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform actions on the output object (which makes it convenient to pass output from one cmdlet to another). 
- The normal format of a cmdlet is represented using Verb-Noun; for example, the cmdlet to list commands is called Get-Command.
- Common verbs to use include: Get, Start, Stop, Read, Write, New, Out.</p>
<br>
What is the command to <strong>get</strong> a <strong>new</strong> object?  <strong>Get-New</strong>
