Goals: understand what is Powershell, learn basic Powershell commands, develop Windows enumeration skills, and learn Powershell scripting<br>
<br>
<p><h2>Task 2 - What is Powershell?</h2>
- Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the .NET framework. <br>
- Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in .NET.<br>
- Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat object-oriented.<br>
- This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform actions on the output object (which makes it convenient to pass output from one cmdlet to another). 
- The normal format of a cmdlet is represented using Verb-Noun; for example, the cmdlet to list commands is called Get-Command.
- Common verbs to use include: Get, Start, Stop, Read, Write, New, Out.</p>

> What is the command to <strong>get</strong> a <strong>new</strong> object?
>> <strong>Get-New</strong>

<br>
<p><h2>Task 3 - Basic Powershell Commands</h2>
Now that we've understood how cmdlets work - let's explore how to use them! The main thing to remember here is that Get-Command and Get-Help are your best friends!<br>
<h3>Using Get-Help</h3>
- Get-Help displays information about a cmdlet. To get help with a particular command, run the following: <br>
- Get-Help Command-Name <br>
- You can also understand how exactly to use the command by passing in the -examples flag. This would return output like the following:</p>
<p><strong>Running the Get-Help cmdlet to explain a command</strong><br>
Get-Help Get-Command -Examples</p>

<h3>Using Get-Command</h3>
- Get-Command gets all the cmdlets installed on the current Computer.<br>
- The great thing about this cmdlet is that it allows for pattern matching like the following<br>
- Get-Command Verb-* or Get-Command *-Noun <br>
- Running Get-Command New-* to view all the cmdlets for the verb new displays the following: <br>
<p></p><strong>Using the Get-Command to list all cmdlets installed</strong><br>
Get-Command New-*</p>

<br>

<h3>Object Manipulation</h3>
- In the previous task, we saw how the output of every cmdlet is an object. If we want to manipulate the output, we need to figure out a few things: <br>
-- passing the output to other cmdlets<br>
-- using specific object cmdlets to extract information<br>
- The Pipeline(|) is used to pass output from one cmdlet to another. A major difference compared to other shells is that Powershell passes an object to the next cmdlet instead of passing text or string to the command after the pipe. Like every object in object-oriented frameworks, an object will contain methods and properties.<br>
You can think of methods as functions that can be applied to output from the cmdlet, and you can think of properties as variables in the output from a cmdlet. To view these details, pass the output of a cmdlet to the Get-Member cmdlet:<br>

Verb-Noun | Get-Member <br>

An example of running this to view the members for Get-Command is: <br>

Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method <br>

<p><strong>Using pipe (|) to pass output from one cmdlet to another</strong><br>
Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method</p>

<p><h2>Task 4 - Enumeration</h2>
- The first step when you have gained initial access to any machine would be to enumerate.<br>
- We'll be enumerating the following: users, basic networking information, file permissions, registry permissions, scheduled and running tasks
insecure files. <br>
- Your task will be to answer the following questions to enumerate the machine using Powershell commands!  </p>

<p><h2>Task 5 - Basic Scripting Challenge</h2>
Now that we have run Powershell commands, let's try to write and run a script to do more complex and powerful actions. <br>
For this ask, we'll use Powershell ISE (the Powershell Text Editor). Let's use a particular scenario to show an example of this script. Given a list of port numbers, we want to use this list to see if the local port is listening. Open the listening-ports.ps1 script on the Desktop using Powershell ISE. Powershell scripts usually have the .ps1 file extension. </p>

<p>> $system_ports = Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen
> $text_port = Get-Content -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\ports.txt
> foreach($port in $text_port){
>    if($port -in $system_ports.LocalPort){
>        echo $port
>     }
>}</p>
<br>
<p>On the first line, we want to get a list of all the ports on the system that are listening. We do this using the Get-NetTCPConnection cmdlet. We are then saving the output of this cmdlet into a variable. The convention to create variables is used as:</p>
> $variable_name = value
<p>In the following line, we want to read a list of ports from the file. We do this using the Get-Content cmdlet. Again, we store this output in the variables. The simplest next step is to iterate through all the ports in the file to see if the ports are listening. To iterate through the ports in the file, we use the following:</p>
> foreach($new_var in $existing_var){}
<p>This particular code block is used to loop through a set of objects. Once we have each individual port, we want to check if this port occurs in the listening local ports. Instead of doing another for loop, we just use an if statement with the -in operator to check if the port exists in the LocalPort property of any object. A full list of if statement comparison operators can be found here. To run the script, call the script path using Powershell or click the green button on Powershell ISE:</p>



<p>Now that we've seen what a basic script looks like - it's time to write one of your own. The emails folder on the Desktop contains copies of the emails John, Martha, and Mary have been sending to each other(and themselves). Answer the following questions with regard to these emails (try not to open the files and use a script to answer the questions). <br>

Scripting may be a bit difficult, but here is a good resource to use: </p?

<strong>5.1 - What file contains the password?<strong> <br>
> Doc3M<br>
>> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\emails -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-String “password”<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f257f6e-2742-4c87-8f7b-ea4e7cf71cb6)

<strong>5.2 - What is the password??<strong> <br>

<strong>5.3 - What files contains an HTTPS link?<strong> <br>
>Doc2Mary

<p><h2>Task 6 - Intermediate Scripting</h2>
Now that you've learnt a little bit about how scripting works - let's try something a bit more interesting. Sometimes we may not have utilities like Nmap and Python available, and we are forced to write scripts to do very rudimentary tasks.

Why don't you try writing a simple port scanner using Powershell? Here's the general approach to use: 

Determine IP ranges to scan(in this case it will be localhost) and you can provide the input in any way you want
Determine the port ranges to scan
Determine the type of scan to run(in this case it will be a simple TCP Connect Scan) </p>

<strong>6.1 - How many open ports did you find between 130 and 140(inclusive of those two)?<strong> <br>
>Doc2Mary


$ErrorActionPreference -eq "SilentlyContinue"
$Target -eq "localhost"
$LowEnd = 130
$HighEnd = 140
$X = 0

Do
{
$CurrentPort = $LowEnd + $X
if((Test-NetConnection -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue $Target -Port $CurrentPort).PingSucceeded -or (Test-NetConnection -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue $Target -Port $CurrentPort).TcpTestSucceeded)
{$CurrentPort | Out-File .\OpenPorts.txt -Append}
$X = $X + 1
}
While($CurrentPort -lt 140)

(Get-Content .\OpenPorts.txt).Count
