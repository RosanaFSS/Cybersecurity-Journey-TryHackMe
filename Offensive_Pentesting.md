<p><h2>Task 2 - What is Powershell?</h2>
- Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the .NET framework. <br>
- Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in .NET.<br>
- Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat object-oriented.<br>
- This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform actions on the output object (which makes it convenient to pass output from one cmdlet to another). 
- The normal format of a cmdlet is represented using Verb-Noun; for example, the cmdlet to list commands is called Get-Command.
- Common verbs to use include: Get, Start, Stop, Read, Write, New, Out.</p>

>> <strong>Get-New</strong>

<br>
<p><h2>Task 3 - Basic Powershell Commands</h2>
Now that we've understood how cmdlets work - let's explore how to use them! The main thing to remember here is that Get-Command and Get-Help are your best friends!<br>
<h3>Using Get-Help</h3>
- Get-Help displays information about a cmdlet. To get help with a particular command, run the following: <br>
- Get-Help Command-Name <br>
- You can also understand how exactly to use the command by passing in the -examples flag. This would return output like the following:</p>
<p></p><strong>Running the Get-Help cmdlet to explain a command</strong><br>
Get-Help Get-Command -Examples<br>

<h3>Using Get-Command</h3>
- Get-Command gets all the cmdlets installed on the current Computer.<br>
- The great thing about this cmdlet is that it allows for pattern matching like the following<br>
- Get-Command Verb-* or Get-Command *-Noun <br>
- Running Get-Command New-* to view all the cmdlets for the verb new displays the following: <br>
<p></p><strong>Using the Get-Command to list all cmdlets installed</strong><br>
Get-Command New-*</p>

<p><strong>Using pipe (|) to pass output from one cmdlet to another</strong><br>
Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method</p>

<p><strong>Listing the directories and filtering via mode and name</strong><br>
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Property Mode, Name</p>

<p><strong>Demonstrating the use of operators only to show stopped services</strong><br>
Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped</p>

<p><strong>Using the Sort-Object cmdlet to sort piped information</strong><br>
Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped</p>
