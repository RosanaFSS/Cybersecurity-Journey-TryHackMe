<h2>Task 1 . The Marketplace</h2>
<p>The sysadmin of The Marketplace, Michael, has given you access to an internal server of his, so you can pentest the marketplace platform he and his team has been working on. He said it still has a few bugs he and his team need to iron out.<br><br>

Can you take advantage of this and will you be able to gain root access on his server?</p>
