<h2>Task 1 . Enter the Chrome</h2>

<p>[  Download Task Files  ]</p>

<p>A password manager is only as strong as the password that encrypts it. You find that a malicious actor extracted something over the network, but what? Help us find out!<br><br>



Click on the Download Task Files button at the top of this task. You will be provided with a chromefiles.zip file.<br><br>



Extract the zip file's contents and recover the information in order to answer the questions.<br><br>



Note: For free users using the AttackBox, the challenge is best done using your own environment. Some browsers may detect the file as malicious. The zip file is safe to download with md5 of cc7b7d9dc26e9a5829bc981b82a923c6. In general, as a security practice, download the zip and analyze the forensic files on a dedicated virtual machine, and not on your host OS.</p>
