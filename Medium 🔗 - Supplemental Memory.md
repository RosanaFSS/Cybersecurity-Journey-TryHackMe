and I’m excited to join you on this adventure,<br>
part of my <code>404</code>-day-streak in<a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a>.<br>

<h2> Task 1 . Introduction</h2>

<p>As a DFIR team member in this room, you are tasked with conducting a memory analysis of a Windows workstation image suspected to have been compromised by a threat actor.<br><br>

This room is designed for DFIR team members, Threat Hunters, and SOC L2/L3 analysts who want to improve and reinforce their skills in memory analysis during a potential incident in order to understand better the value that memory dump investigation can provide in such scenarios.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p> In this room, we will examine the footprints of the adversary's actions in the compromised Linux server. Some of the key topics that we will cover are:<br>

- Uncover the TryHatMe breach with just a memory dump.<br>
- Identify suspicious processes and network connections.<br>
- Explore traces of execution and discovery actions.<br>
- Detect signs of potential lateral movement and credential dumping.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>It is suggested to clear the following rooms first before proceeding:<br>

- <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsmemoryandprocs/">Windows Memory & Processes</a><br>
- <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsmemoryanduseractivity">Windows Memory & User Activity</a><br>
- <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsmemoryandnetwork">Windows Memory & Network</a></p>
