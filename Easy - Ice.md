<p>Connect to our network using OpenVPN. Here is a mini walkthrough of connecting:<br>

Go to your access page and download your configuration file.</p>

<br>

<p>Use an OpenVPN client to connect. In my example I am on Linux, on the access page we have a windows tutorial.</p>

<p align="center"> <img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f7f13e-e2b9-49d7-8a57-b24e2625d4dd"> </p>

<p>When you run this you see lots of text, at the end it will say Initialization Sequence Completed</p>

>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code>

<p>You can verify you are connected by looking on your access page. Refresh the page.<br>

You should see a green tick next to Connected. It will also show you your internal IP address.</p>
