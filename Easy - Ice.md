<h2>Task 1. Connect<a id='1'></a></h2>

<p align="center">Connect to the TryHackMe network! Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up.</p>

<p align="center">The virtual machine used in this room (Ice) can be downloaded for offline usage from https://darkstar7471.com/resources.html. The sequel to this room, Blaster, can be found here.</p>

<p>Connect to our network using OpenVPN. Here is a mini walkthrough of connecting:<br>

Go to your access page and download your configuration file.</p>

<p align="center"> <img width="400px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9429b290-c5f4-4ef9-9d9a-2d8ad6963347"> </p>

>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code>

<br>

<p>Use an OpenVPN client to connect. In my example I am on Linux, on the access page we have a windows tutorial.</p>

<p>When you run this you see lots of text, at the end it will say Initialization Sequence Completed</p>

>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code>

<p>You can verify you are connected by looking on your access page. Refresh the page.<br>

You should see a green tick next to Connected. It will also show you your internal IP address.</p>

<p>You are now ready to use our machines on our network!</p>

>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code>

<p>Now when you deploy material, you will see an internal IP address of your Virtual Machine.</p>

> 3.1. <em>Now that we've identified some interesting services running on our target machine, let's do a little bit of research into one of the weirder services identified: Icecast. Icecast, or well at least this version running on our target, is heavily flawed and has a high level vulnerability with a score of 7.5 (7.4 depending on where you view it). What is the Impact Score for this vulnerability? Use https://www.cvedetails.com for this question and the next.</em><br><a id='3.1'></a>

>> <code><strong>________</strong></code>

<br>

> 3.3. <em>Now that we've found our vulnerability, let's find our exploit. For this section of the room, we'll use the Metasploit module associated with this exploit. Let's go ahead and start Metasploit using the command `msfconsole`</em><br><a id='3.3'></a>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code>

<br>

> 3.4. <em>After Metasploit has started, let's search for our target exploit using the command 'search icecast'. What is the full path (starting with exploit) for the exploitation module? If you are not familiar with metasploit, take a look at the Metasploit module.`</em><br><a id='3.4'></a>

<br>

> 3.5. <em>Let's go ahead and select this module for use. Type either the command `use icecast` or `use 0` to select our search result.</em><br><a id='3.5'></a>
