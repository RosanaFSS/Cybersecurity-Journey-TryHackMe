<h2>Task 4. Persistence Mechanisms I</h2>
<p>ï»¿It looks like our attacker got in via Remote File Inclusion (RFI). It's best to look around the system itself now for any evidence of persistence.</p>
- cron<vr></vr>
- Services/systemd<br>
- bashrc<br>
- Kernel modules <br>
- SSH keys<br>

<p>Cron is one of the more common methodologies, so it's probably best to start there.</p>

<h2>Task 5. User Accounts</h2>
<p>It looks like the command from the previous task was set up to run under the root2 account. This account doesn't make any sense as there should only be one root account. Wonder how it got there?<br>

There are a couple of locations where account information is stored on Linux distributions, including:</p>

<br>

<p>1. /etc/passwd  - contains the names of most of the accounts on the system.  Should have open read permissions and should not contain password hashes. <br>
2. /etc/shadow -  contains names but should also contain password hashes.  Should have strict permissions.</p>

<p>If there is a x after the first colon, then it means that the password hash is stored in the /etc/shadow file</p>

<h2>Task 6. Deploy the second VM</h2>

<h2>Task 7. Apache Log Analysis II</h2>

<p>The log file is a lot smaller this time around, so it looks like our attacker was a little more subtle. There also don't appear to be obvious user agents anymore. Fortunately, there are a few other ways of identifying traffic originating from scanners. The time between each request is a good metric for most tools. You can also identify individual tools from signatures left in the requests; for example, Nmap will send HTTP requests with a random non-standard method when performing certain enumeration tasks. More aggressive tools can also be identified simply from the number of requests sent during any given attack; directory brute-forcing tools are a perfect example of this and are likely to fall foul of banning systems like fail2ban.<br>

A poorly designed site may also freely grant valuable information without the need for aggressive tools. In this case, the site uses sequential IDs for all of the products making. It easily scrapes every single product or finds the total size of the product database by simply increasing the product ID until a 404 error occurs.</p>

<h2>Task 8. Persistence Mechanisms II</h2>
<p>The adversary has been a little smarter this time around. If any backdoor exists, it's likely to be more subtle. SSH-keys are another excellent way of maintaining access, so it might be worth looking for additions to the authorized_keys file. </p>
