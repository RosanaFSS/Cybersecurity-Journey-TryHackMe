<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 169-day-streak. Let´s get started!!<br><br>

<h2>Task 1 - What are Vulnerabilities?</h2>
<p>Imagine you are living in a small, lovely house. One day, you notice that your roof has many small holes. If not treated, these small holes can cause significant problems. During rain, water can come through these leaks and damage your furniture. Dust particles and insects can enter the house through these tiny holes. These small holes are a weakness in your home that can lead to significant problems in the future if not addressed timely. These weaknesses are known as <strong><em>Vulberabilities</em></strong>. You start repairing the roof to fix this problem and keep your home safe. This process of fixing the vulnerabilities is known as <strong><em>Patching</em></strong>.<br><br>

Digital devices also have vulnerabilities inside their software or hardware. These are the weaknesses in the software programs or hardware that an attacker can leverage to compromise the digital device. These vulnerabilities may sound normal to you, like the small holes in the roof of a house that can be repaired anytime. However, the vulnerabilities in digital devices can lead to massive damage if not noticed on time. Hackers are always searching for these weaknesses as they make their way to your systems or networks by exploiting them. The interesting thing about digital device vulnerabilities is that you cannot notice them as easily as the holes in the roof until you dedicate yourself to hunting them down. After hunting these vulnerabilities down, the process of patching starts, where fixes are applied to protect the vulnerabilities.<br><br>

This room is about learning how to hunt these vulnerabilities in digital devices. We will study some of the available tools to automate this hunting and leverage one of the tools to demonstrate how it’s done practically.<br></p>

<h2>Task 2 - Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
<p>Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weaknesses. Organizations carry critical information in their digital infrastructure. They must regularly scan their systems and networks for vulnerabilities, as attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise their digital infrastructure, resulting in a considerable loss. Vulnerability scanning is also an important compliance requirement of many regulatory bodies. Some security standards advise performing vulnerability scanning quarterly, while some advise performing it once a year.<br><br>

We saw how important it is to conduct vulnerability scans in your digital landscape regularly; however, manually looking for these weaknesses can be very hectic and miss some major ones. The bigger the network is, the slower the process of manual vulnerability scanning would be. This is no longer an issue as some efficient vulnerability scanners that perform automated vulnerability scanning are available in the market. This automated vulnerability scanning has made life much easier. You only need to install the tool and give it an IP address for a host or a network range for a network; it will start checking vulnerabilities and give you an easy-to-read report with the details of the vulnerabilities found.<br><br>

After identifying vulnerabilities, organizations fix them by making changes to a software program or system. These changes are referred to as <strong><em>Patches</em></strong>.

Vulnerability scans can be categorized into many types; however, the major categorization of these scans are explained below:.</p>
<p></p>

<h3><strong>Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans</strong></h3>
<p>Authenticated scans require the subject host's credentials and are more detailed than unauthenticated scans. These types of scans are helpful for discovering the threat surface within the host. However, unauthenticated scans are conducted without providing any credentials of the subject host. These scans help identify the threat surface from outside the host.<br></p>

| Authenticate Scans                             | Unauthenticated Scans                          |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: | 
| The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner. | The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner. | 
| The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner. | Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host. |
| Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host. | Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host. |
| Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host. | Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host. |

<h3><strong>Internal vs. External Scans</strong></h3>

<p>Internal scans are conducted from inside the network, while external scans are conducted from outside the network. Let's see a few of their differences below.<br></p>
<p></p>

| Internal Scans                                 | External Scans                                 |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: | 
| Conducted from inside the network. | Conducted from inside the network. | 
| It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited inside the network. | It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network. | 
| Identifies vulnerabilities that would be exposed to the attackers once they get inside the network. | Identifies vulnerabilities that would be exposed to the attackers once they get inside the network. |

<p></p>
<p>The choice between vulnerability scan types depends on several factors. Authenticated scans are often used for internal vulnerability scanning, while unauthenticated scans are mostly used for external vulnerability scanning.<br></p>

> 2.1 - <em>Which type of vulnerability scans require the credentials of the target host?</em><br>
>> <strong>Authenticated</strong><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.2 - <em>Which type of vulnerability scans require the credentials of the target host?</em><br>
>> <strong>External</strong><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 3 - IDS Example: Snort</h2>

> 3.1 - <em>Which mode of Snort helps us to log the network traffic in a PCAP file?</em><br>
>> <strong>Packet Logging Mode</strong><br>
<p></p>

> 3.2 - <em>What is the primary mode of Snort called?</em><br>
>> <strong>Network Intrusion Detection System Mode</strong><br>
<p></p>

<h2>Task 4 - Snort Usage</h2>

> 4.1 - <em>Where is the main directory of Snort that stores its files?</em><br>
>> <strong>/etc/snort</strong><br>
<p></p>

> 4.2 - <em>Which field in the Snort rule indicates the revision number of the rule?</em><br>
>> <strong>rev</strong><br>
<p></p>

> 4.3 - <em>Which protocol is defined in the sample rule created in the task?</em><br>
>> <strong>icmp</strong><br>
<p></p>

> 4.4 - <em>What is the file name that contains custom rules for Snort?</em><br>
>> <strong>local.rules</strong><br>
<p></p>


<h2>Task 5 - Practical Lab</h2>

>5.1 - <em>What is the IP address of the machine that tried to connect to the subject machine using SSH?</em><br>
>> <strong>10.11.90.211</strong><br>
<p></p>
<pre><code>sudo snort -q -l /etc/snort -r Intro_to_IDS.pcap -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf</code></pre>
