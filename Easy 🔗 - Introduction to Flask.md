<p align="center">May 19, 2025<br> Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! IÂ´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and Iâ€™m excited to join you on this adventure, part of my $$\textcolor{#FF69B4}{\textbf{378}}$$-day-streak in  <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a><br>
How it works and how can I exploit it? It is an easy-level walkthrough. You can join it for ðŸ†“ using your own virtual machine with openVPN or TryHackMeÂ´s AttackBox if you are subscribed.  Access it clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/flask"</a>here.<br>

<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<p>This room continues my python-frameworks series. Learning Python can be extremely useful for penetration testers, and a simple understanding of its frameworks can be a key to success. In this room (lesson), we are going to learn about one of the easiest and fastest ones. <br><br>

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and several common framework related tools. <br>

<p>To be short, Flask does not require much work from you and can be coded and deployed in a matter of a couple of minutes!</p>

<p>You'll find Flask especially easy if you find <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/django"</a> Django too complicated :)</p>

<p>https://github.com/Swafox/Flask-examples <-- Here's the collection of all scripts that are going to be used in this room.</p>

<h2>Task 2. Installation and Deployment basics</h2>
<p>Let's proceed with basic installation. For this room, we are going to use Python3. You can get it for both Windows and Linux here:<br><br>
<a href="https://www.python.org/"</a>Link</p>

<p>Now open up a terminal/cmd and install Flask by running:<br><br>
<code>pip3 install Flask</code><br><br>

After a couple of seconds, you'll get everything you need for using Flask.<br><br>

Make a separate directory for your demo project and start a virtual environment there. Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each project. Packages installed for one project will not affect other projects or the operating systemâ€™s packages. Python 3 comes bundled with the venv module to create virtual environments. (tl;dr a virtual environment isolates your project from the system to prevent any conflicts). 
Run <code>pip3 install virtualenv</code> if you get an error running venv later on.</p>

<h3>On Linux run:</h3>
<p><code>mkdir myproject<br>
cd myproject<br>
python3 -m venv venv</code></p>

<br>

<br>

<h3>On Windows run:</h3>
<p><code>mkdir myproject<br>
cd myproject<br>
py-3 -m venv venv</code></p>

<br>

<br>

<p>Now you need to create and set a Flask file, aka a script that is going to contain the flask code. Create a file with a name of your choice and run the following command depending on your system:<br><br>

Windows: <code>set FLASK_APP=hello.py</code><br>
Linux: <code>export FLASK_APP=hello.py</code><br>
(Change <code>hello.py</code> to whatever name you came up with earlier)<br><br>


And that's that! All you have to do now is run<br>
<code>flask run</code><br>
or<br>
<code>flask run --host=0.0.0.0</code><br>
to deploy a flask app locally or publically (on your network).<br><br>

Note: You are going to get an error if you deploy the app at this point since we have no code written.</p>
