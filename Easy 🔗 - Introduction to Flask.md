<p align="center">May 19, 2025<br> Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! IÂ´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and Iâ€™m excited to join you on this adventure, part of my $$\textcolor{#FF69B4}{\textbf{378}}$$-day-streak in  <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a><br>
How it works and how can I exploit it? It is an easy-level walkthrough. You can join it for ðŸ†“ using your own virtual machine with openVPN or TryHackMeÂ´s AttackBox if you are subscribed.  Access it clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/flask"</a>here.<br>

<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<p>This room continues my python-frameworks series. Learning Python can be extremely useful for penetration testers, and a simple understanding of its frameworks can be a key to success. In this room (lesson), we are going to learn about one of the easiest and fastest ones. >br><br>

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and several common framework related tools. <br>

<p>To be short, Flask does not require much work from you and can be coded and deployed in a matter of a couple of minutes!</p>

<p>You'll find Flask especially easy if you find <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/django"</a> Django too complicated :)</p>
