<h2>Task 1- . Summary</h2>
<p>During this room, you have learned some history about cloud technology and the basic benefits of using "the cloud". You should now understand:<br>

- How technology limitations in the 1990s and 2000s drove the development of "cloud technologies".<br>
- How capabilities associated with reliability and scalability are hallmarks of cloud service providers.<br>
- How companies may see cost and IT agility benefits from using the cloud.<br>
- How an API first approach was powerful and also had drawbacks.<br>
- How AWS provides various services, capabilities, code, and documentation for free.<br><br>
This background knowledge should serve as helpful context as you further explore cloud technologies, and specifically, our other AWS rooms.</p>
