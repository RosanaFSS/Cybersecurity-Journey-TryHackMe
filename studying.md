<h1 align="center">SOC Level 1 learning path</h1>
<p>The Security Operations Center (SOC) is a central hub for securing many large organizations, and junior analysts are among the most numerous and demanding roles in a SOC. In the analyst role, you will work with logs, triage and prioritize alerts, collaborate with your teammates and other departments, and be the first line of defense in reacting to cyber incidents. This comprehensive path covers the necessary technical and operational skills to make you a qualified, universal SOC analyst.</p>

<br>
<h2 align="center">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You need a basic understanding of network fundamentals and operating systems. If you do not already have this knowledge, complete the Pre-Security Pathway and Cyber Security 101, or be prepared to research new concepts as you progress.</p>

<h3>Scenario Overview</h3>
<p>Learn how to use SOC Simulator by completing your first scenario. Close all True Positive alerts to pass!</p>

<h3>Scenario Objectives</h3>
<p>

- Monitor and analyze real-time alerts.<br>
Identify and document critical events such as suspicious emails and attachments.<br>
Create detailed case reports based on your observations to help your team understand the full scope of alerts and malicious activity.</p>


<h3>Choose your SIEM tool</h3>
<p>Choose the platform you'd like to use during this simulation. Select Splunk, Elastic or Sentinel depending on what you're familiar with or want to explore</p>

<p>

- Splunk: Best for users familiar with or training in this industry-standard tool.<br>
- Elastic: Great for those with experience using Kibana and Elasticsearch.<br>
- Sentinel: For users comfortable with Microsoft, KQL, Log Analytics Workspace, and Sentinel.</p>
