<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 25-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program. Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap04">Nmap Post Port Scans</a></p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>This room is the last in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In this room, we focus on the steps that follow port-scanning: in particular, service detection, OS detection, Nmap scripting engine, and saving the scan results.<br>
<ol type="1. ">
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap01">Nmap Live Host Discover</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap02">Nmap Basic Port Scans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap03">Nmap Advanced Port Scans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/nmap04">Nmap Post Port Scans</a></li>
</ol></p>
<p>In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.<br><br>
In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:</p>
<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)</li>
  <li>Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)</li>
  <li>Run Nmap’s traceroute</li>
  <li>Run select Nmap scripts</li>
  <li>Save the scan results in various formats</li>
</ol></p>

<p>This room will focus on these steps and how to execute them after the port scan.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Service Detection</h2>
