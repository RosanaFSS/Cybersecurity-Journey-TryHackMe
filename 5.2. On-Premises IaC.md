<h2>Task 1. Introduction<a id='1'></a></h2>

<p>In this room, you will learn about on-premises infrastructure as code (IaC) deployments. While this may seem outdated in a cloud-based world, some good reasons exist for doing on-prem instead of cloud deployments, especially in heavily regulated industries.</p>

<br>

<h2>Task 2. Why On-Premises<a id='2'></a></h2>
<p>On-premises IaC refers to using infrastructure as code to deploy systems and services on an internal network. In essence, all the infrastructure that will host the systems and services can be found locally in the organisation's data centre.</p>

<h3>Reasons for On-Prem IaC</h3>
<p>In the modern world, where we have several cloud providers, using on-prem IaC may seem counter-intuitive. However, there are some cases where on-prem IaC will suit your needs much better. The biggest benefit is that it allows you much better control of your entire IaC pipeline. Let's use another popular example, GitHub vs self-hosted GitLab, as a case study.<br>

GitHub and GitLab are two popular source code management platforms, backed by the popular versioning software Git, that are used by organisations. However, deciding between the two often becomes a question of control. If you self-host the solution using GitLab, you fully control the entire stack. You are ultimately not only responsible for the management of the GitLab platform, but also the underlying infrastructure. While this is a lot more work, it also allows you to lock down access significantly. For example, you could only allow access to your GitLab instance via VPN, meaning it is not exposed to the internet for everyone.<br>

Conversely, using GitHub means you are shifting some of that security responsibility. It is important to remember that GitHub is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution. That means that if you use GitHub, you have no control over the infrastructure hosting your source code. Instead, you are transferring the security responsibility of infrastructure management to GitHub, which becomes a third party of your organisation. While these organisations take security measures seriously, their security is not without flaws, which can leave your organisation's source code exposed. This is a risk that you have to accept whenever you use a third party.<br>

Extrapolating from this case study, you should see why some organisations still prefer on-prem IaC, especially in heavily regulated sectors, such as the financial or governmental sectors. While on-prem IaC is definitely more effort, it provides an organisation with full control and customisation of their IaC pipeline.</p>

<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>
<p>To summarise why one would use on-prem IaC and determine if it is the correct solution for your specific problem, let's look at the benefits and drawbacks.</p>

<h3><strong>On-prem IaC has the following benefits:</strong></h3>
<p><ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Allows full control of the IaC pipeline</li>
    <li>The IaC pipeline can be fully customised for your exact needs</li>
    <li>Data protection and regulation is easier to perform as the IaC pipeline does not host resources on third-party systems</li>
    <li>While the initial investment cost of the infrastructure is high, there are no monthly fees for hosting the IaC pipeline</li>
    <li>It is often easier to do small deployments</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><strong>On-prem IaC has the following drawbacks:</strong></h3>
<p><ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>As you are hosting your own IaC pipeline, you are fully responsible for its security and configuration</li>
    <li>Scalability of deployments is not as flexible as cloud-based IaC, which can lead to either not having sufficient resources for the deployment or an over-investment in resources</li>
    <li>The initial investment for on-prem IaC is significantly higher than cloud-based IaC</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To summarise why one would use on-prem IaC and determine if it is the correct solution for your specific problem, let's look at the benefits and drawbacks.</p>

<h2>Task 3. Vagrant Basics<a id='3'></a></h2>
<p>In our on-prem IaC journey, we will start with Vagrant. Vagrant is a software solution that can be used for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments. In essence, Vagrant can be used to create resources from an IaC pipeline. You can think of Vagrant as the big brother of Docker. In the context of Vagrant, Docker would be seen as a provider, meaning that Vagrant could be used to not only deploy Docker instances but also the actual servers that would host them.</p>

<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>Before diving into using Vagrant, let's brush up on some terminology first.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/258597a5-d143-4a25-95e2-2185cff843e8)

<h3>Vagrant Example</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a simple Vagrant provisioning script. In our example here, we have the following folder structure:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/560499f2-97ff-4c42-a3e0-2bdc4b0f1cbd)

<br>
<p>The Vagrantfile script has the following code:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/052b7bc9-1ab7-46d2-860d-eb8cb6f74c53)

<p>In this example, we are going to provision two servers. Both of these servers will start with the base Ubuntu Bionic x64 image. Like Docker, these images will be pulled from a public image repo. We could, however, tell Vagrant where to find these images, meaning they can be pulled from a private repo of images as well. You can see that both servers are configured with a hostname and how many CPUs (1) and RAM (4GB) each host will have. The first server will also have two network interfaces with static IPs attached. The second server will have a file called files.zip uploaded, and a script called script.sh will be executed on the host.<br>

If we want to provision the entire script, we would use the command vagrant up. This would provision both servers in the order specified in the Vagrantfile. We could also decide to only provision one of the servers by using the server name. For example, testserver could be provisioned using vagrant up server.<br>

If you want to play around with VirtualBox provisioning using Vagrant, look at this repo. Using VirtualBox and Vagrant, this repo will allow you to create your very own Active Directory (AD) network with two domain controllers, a server, and a workstation. Give the Vagrantfile a read to see what provisioning will be performed on each host.<br>

We will create our very own IaC deployment script a bit later in this room.</p>

<h3 align="left"> $$\textcolor{#a8ec2c}{\textnormal{Answer the questions below}}$$ </h3>

> 3.1. <em>What is the name of the file that Vagrant uses for provisioning?</em><br><a id='3.1'></a>
>> <code><strong>Vagrantfile</strong></code>
<br>

> 3.2. <em>What command can be used to provision all hosts with Vagrant?</em><br><a id='3.2'></a>
>> <code><strong>vagrant up</strong></code>
<br>

> 3.3. <em>What command can be used to provision only the webserver host with Vagrant?</em><br><a id='3.3'></a>
>> <code><strong>vagrant up webserver</strong></code>
<br>

<h2>Task 4. Ansible Basics<a id='4'></a></h2>
<p>The next IaC tool to learn about is Ansible. Like Vagrant, Ansible is another suite of software tools that allows you to perform IaC. Ansible is also open-source, making it a popular choice for IaC pipelines and deployments. One main difference between Ansible and Vagrant is that Ansible performs version control on the steps executed. This means that Ansible is similar to Docker, in that it will only perform updates on steps that require updates, instead of requiring a full reprovision.</p>

<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>Before diving into using Ansible, let's brush up on some terminology first..</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba316715-5904-4f95-a628-fc0c6be74091)

<h3>Ansible Example</h3>
<p>Ansible makes use of a specific folder and file structure. The most important part of the structure is the playbook, a YAML file that ultimately dictates what commands will be executed for provisioning. Let's take a look at the typical folder structure:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b2eb27-1a59-456a-a78a-b9cc7afdfd23)


<p>The folder structure was only expanded for the common role. However, this same structure would apply for roles 2 to 3.<br>

Let's dive a little bit into what each of these files would do. Let's start with the playbook.yml file:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88dc892b-a1ac-4e59-ad96-f59dc8d6329d)

<p>As we can see, the playbook specifies that the common and role3 roles should be applied for all hosts where this Ansible playbook will be executed. It will also use the var.yml file to overwrite any default variables within the roles. This allows us to only change the default variables where needed, as the defaults will then still be applied to all other variables.<br>

To execute the common role, Ansible will load variables from the defaults/main.yml file and overwrite these variables with any new values found in the var.yml file. It will then read and execute the tasks/main.yml file. This file would look something like this:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cb06777-2d79-41a0-89e2-ab1d8fc7d7ae)

<p>The first section of the Ansible file will determine the OS distribution of the host. It will then use this information to include OS-specific provisioning steps. As you can see from our folder structure, we have specific provisioning steps based on whether the distribution is Debian or RedHat. The second section of the playbook will set the root user's password. In the third section, we update the host and install some packages. However, we only execute the installing step matching the OS distribution. If the host is Debian, we will execute the commands specified in the apt.yml file. If the host is RedHat, we will execute the commands specified in the yum.yml file. This allows our Ansible role to be OS distribution agnostic. Lastly, we will execute the commands contained within the task1.yml and task2.yml files. These can be any commands, such as adding files to the host or making configuration changes.<br>

This is quite a lot of information to take in, but as you start using these tools and follow along with what scripts get executed when, it makes a lot more sense.</p>


<h3>Combining Vagrant and Ansible</h3>
<p>While you could stick to one IaC tool for your entire pipeline, it can often be beneficial to combine toolings. For example, Vagrant could be used for the main deployment of hosts, and Ansible can then be used for host-specific configuration. This way, you only use Vagrant when you want to recreate the entire network from scratch but can still use Ansible to make host-specific configuration changes until a full rebuild is required. Ansible would then run locally on each host to perform these configuration changes, while Vagrant will be executed from the hypervisor itself. In order to do this, you could add the following to your Vagrantfile to tell Vagrant to provision an Ansible playbook:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef92b2e-d7dc-4fe9-b548-c1b26568d7a4)

<p>It is also worth noting some of the differences between Vagrant and Ansible, if you are looking to only stick to a single IaC solution:</p>

<p>Now that we have learned about Vagrant and Ansible, let's put this knowledge to use and build our very own IaC pipeline!</p>
