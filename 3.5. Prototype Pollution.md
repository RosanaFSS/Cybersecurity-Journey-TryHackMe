<h2>Task 2 - Essential Recap</h2>
<p>﻿﻿Before we jump into the advanced stuff like prototype pollution, let's first understand some basic things in JavaScript. Think of objects as building blocks that hold information. Inheritance is like passing down traits from one object to another. Functions are like tools that can be used alone or as part of these objects. Lastly, classes in JavaScript are like blueprints that help us make similar things easily. Once we get these basics, we can then explore the more complex topic of prototype pollution in our room.</p>

<h3>Objects</h3>
<p></p>﻿In JavaScript, objects are like containers that can hold different pieces of information. Imagine a social network profile as an object, where each profile has properties like name, age, and followers. You can represent this using curly braces and key-value pairs:</p>

<p>Here, the user is an object with properties such as name, age, and followers.  These properties store specific information about the user. Objects in JavaScript enable us to organise and manage related data, making them a fundamental concept in building dynamic and interactive applications.<br>

To practically test it, open Chrome in the attached VM and once the browser is opened, Right click and select Inspect, then select Console, which will open the following window. Please copy the above code and paste it into the console; it will create a user object for you. Now you can access the properties of the object using console.log as shown below:</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>In JavaScript, classes are like blueprints that help create multiple objects with similar structures and behaviours. Staying with our social network example, we can use a class to define a general user and a content creator. Classes provide a convenient way to organise and instantiate objects with shared characteristics.</p>

<p>Now, the User class includes the Date of Birth (dob) as part of its properties, and the ContentCreatorProfile class inherits this property. When creating instances of these classes, we can provide the Date of Birth and other details. As we can see, including the Date of Birth enhances the user profiles with additional information.</p>


<h3>Prototype</h3>

<p>In JavaScript, every object is linked to a prototype object, and these prototypes form a chain commonly referred to as the prototype chain. The prototype serves as a template or blueprint for objects. When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, JavaScript automatically sets up a link between the object and its prototype. In the context of our social network example, let's illustrate how prototypes work:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ee0e59d-2fa8-4042-bd11-d39ac4fa7e66)

<p>You can copy and play with the code in the attached VM to see how JavaScript objects work.</p>

<h3>Difference between Class and Prototype</h3>

<p>Classes and prototypes in JS are two ways to achieve a similar goal: creating objects with behaviours and characteristics. Imagine you're building models of cars in your room. Using classes is like having a detailed blueprint or a set of instructions for each car model you want to develop. You follow the blueprint exactly to create each car, and all cars made from the exact blueprint are guaranteed to have the same features and behaviours. Classes in JavaScript work similarly; they provide a clear, structured way to create objects that share the same properties and methods, making them easy to understand and use.

On the other hand, prototypes are like having a basic car model and then customising it by adding or modifying features directly on the car itself. With prototypes, you start with a simple object and then add behaviours to it by linking it to a prototype object that already has those behaviours. Objects created this way are linked through the prototype chain, allowing them to inherit behaviours from other objects. This method is more dynamic and flexible but can be harder to manage and understand than the structured approach of classes.</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>In JavaScript, inheritance allows one object to inherit properties from another, creating a hierarchy of related objects. Continuing with our social network example, let's consider a more specific profile for a content creator. This new object can inherit properties from the general user profile, like name and followers, and add particular properties, such as content and posts.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcab52cf-e023-48f6-94a5-13cb313d792a)


<p>Here, contentCreatorProfile inherits properties from the user using Object.create(). Now, it has specific properties like content and posts and inherits name, age, and followers from the general user profile, as shown below.</p>

<h2>Task 3 - How it Works</h2>

<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of JavaScript, let's dive into Prototype Pollution using the same social network example.image of character holding the laptop Prototype pollution is a vulnerability that arises when an attacker manipulates an object's prototype, impacting all instances of that object. In JavaScript, where prototypes facilitate inheritance, an attacker can exploit this to modify shared properties or inject malicious behaviour across objects.<br>

Prototype pollution, on its own, might not always present a directly exploitable threat. However, its true potential for harm becomes notably pronounced when it joins with other types of vulnerabilities, such as XSS and CSRF.</p>
