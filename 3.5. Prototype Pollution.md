<h1>Task 2 - Essential Recap</h1>
<p>﻿﻿Before we jump into the advanced stuff like prototype pollution, let's first understand some basic things in JavaScript. Think of objects as building blocks that hold information. Inheritance is like passing down traits from one object to another. Functions are like tools that can be used alone or as part of these objects. Lastly, classes in JavaScript are like blueprints that help us make similar things easily. Once we get these basics, we can then explore the more complex topic of prototype pollution in our room.</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>
<p></p>﻿In JavaScript, objects are like containers that can hold different pieces of information. Imagine a social network profile as an object, where each profile has properties like name, age, and followers. You can represent this using curly braces and key-value pairs:</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>h2?

<p>In JavaScript, every object is linked to a prototype object, and these prototypes form a chain commonly referred to as the prototype chain. The prototype serves as a template or blueprint for objects. When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, JavaScript automatically sets up a link between the object and its prototype. In the context of our social network example, let's illustrate how prototypes work:</p>
