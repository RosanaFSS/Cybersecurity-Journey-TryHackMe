<h2>Advent of Cyber 3 (2021)
<h2>Day 8, SantaÂ´s Bag of Toys</h2>

<p>McSkidy was notified of some terrible news! Santa's laptop, which he uses to prepare his bag of toys for Christmas, is missing! We believe a minion at the Grinch Enterprise stole it, but we need to find out for sure. It is up to us to determine what actor compromised the laptop and recover Santa's bag of toys!<br>

Unfortunately, The Best Festival Company had minimal monitoring tools on Santa's laptop (he is the boss, after all)! All we have to work with are some PowerShell Transcription Logs we were able to remotely recover just after it went missing. You can find the transcription logs within the SantasLaptopLogs folder on the Desktop of the attached Windows virtual machine.<br>

If you aren't familiar, PowerShell Transcription Logs capture the input and output of Windows PowerShell commands, allowing an analyst to review what happened when. Typically, PowerShell Transcription can be enabled by Group Policy, but another method to turn on this logging is by configuring the Windows Registry.</p>

<p>While you do not have to use these commands for this task, these will turn on PowerShell Transcription Logging for a local host if entered in an Administrator command prompt:<br>

reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription /v EnableTranscripting /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f<br>
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription /v OutputDirectory /t REG_SZ /d C:/ /f<br>
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription /v EnableInvocationHeader /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f<br>
The Windows Registry is a large database of operating system settings and configurations. It is organized by "hives", with each hive containing "keys" and their corresponding "values." PowerShell Transcription Logging can be enabled in this way "per-user" via the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive, or across the entire host via the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry hive. Thankfully, Santa's laptop had this enabled machine-wide!<br>

Note that for this task, you will interact with a Windows virtual machine to perform your analysis. For the sake of storyline, this is not Santa's laptop... rather, you have sample files that were recovered before the laptop was stolen.
