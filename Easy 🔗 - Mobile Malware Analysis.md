<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<p>It's incredible how often our computers are in the scope of cyber attacks. Antivirus has become an indispensable shield to provide us with a more secure environment, since we are exposed to destructible malware and cyber attacks. Inside our pockets, we have computers so powerful, but much smaller, we must be equally attentive on our phones, because we can suffer equally damaging attacks, sometimes even worse, because they can store relevant information such as private conversations and important accounts.</p>
<p>Content Security Policy, or CSP, is a policy usually sent via an HTTP response header from the webserver to your browser when requesting a page that describes which sources of content the browser should allow to be loaded in, and which ones should be blocked. In case an XSS or data injection vulnerability is found in a website, CSP is designed to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited until it's properly patched, and should serve as an extra layer of protection, not as your only line of defense. <br>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>1.1. Read the text above.<br>
<code>Content Security Policy</code></p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Task 2 . An Unknown Land</h2>
<p>It is important to look at the past to understand why things are as they are today.<br><br>
A new technology, due to the lack of exploration, appears to be extremely reliable.<br><br>
Every system is reliable, until someone proves otherwise.<br><br>
You will need to do some research in order to answer the questions in this task.</p>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>2.1. What known as the first malware created to affect mobile devices?<br>
<code>Cabir</code></p>

<br>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e1edad-c46c-496a-848c-91fbc5c2c45b"><br><br><em>Wikipedia</em></h6>

<br>

<p>2.2. What technology does this worm used to multiply?<br>
<code>Bluetooth</code></p>

<br>

<p>2.3. What operating system did it infect?<br>
<code>Symbian</code></p>

<br>

<p>2.4. What message did it show on the screen of the infected mobile phone?<br>
<code>Caribe</code></p>

<br>

<p>2.5. The worm was created and sent out by researchers as a PoC (Proof of Concept), they did not believe that the mobile operating system could be easily exploited. Since then, malicious programs have become more popular. <br>

<h2>Task 3 . Small size, a lot of destruction.</h2>
<p>There is a weird file inside this machine, it looks malicious, but let's not jump into conclusions.<br><br>

Deploy the machine in this task and wait for the connection to the machine to be made in your browser.</p>

<p align="center">You can also c align="center"onnect to the TryHackMe VPN & use an RDP client of your choice using the following credentials:<br>

<h2>Task 4 . Digging Deeper</h2>
<p>Let's make a deeper analysis.<br><br>

VirusTotal is a incredible service, this web site can give us the power of analyze a package with the database of more then seventy Anti-Virus, and the result is fast and accurate.<br><br>

https://www.virustotal.com/<br><br>

To analyze the file in VirusTotal, you will need the file hash, you can get it by using the powershell cmdlet "Get-FileHash" or you can analyze the filw with MobSF and it will show the file hash (we will get back to this tool in the next task).</p>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>4.1. What does Avast-Mobile can tell us about this software? Hint : Use VirusTotal to check the file.<br>
<code>Android:Metasploit-Q [PUP]</code></p>

<br>


<p>4.2. What program was used to create the malware?<br>
<code>Metasploit</code></p>


<br>

<p>4.3.The results provided by VirusTotal shows that we have a generic malware. It does not serve for attack purposes because we can see that a good part of the Antiviruses are detecting it, this malware is a good one for searching purposes, but it is also used for post exploitation.<br>
<code>No answer needed</code></p>


<br>

<p>4.4. What is the package name?<br>

<br>
<h2>Task 5 . MobSFing the sample</h2>
<p>Let's use MobSF(Mobile Security Framework) to make a deeper analysis of this file, MobSF is a software created to make a security focused analysis of Android and IOS files. It can check for misconfigurations, leaked data and much more in a mobile program.<br><br>

This tool can be used for static and dinamic analysis, in this room we will focus only in the static analysis but you are free to install it in a virtual machine you own to understand more how the application works, you can install it in GitHub - https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.<br><br>

The machine is configured to start MobSF when deployed, if you accidentally closed the web page you can visit the MobSF page by visiting the link http://127.0.0.1:8000 inside the deployed machine. Press the "Upload & Analyze" button and select the file we have been working on.
