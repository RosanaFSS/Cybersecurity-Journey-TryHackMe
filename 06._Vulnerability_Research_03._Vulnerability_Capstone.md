<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 29-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/vulnerabilitycapstone">Vulnerability Capstone</a>. <code>Note</code>: only subscribers can deploy Virtual Machines in this room.</p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>

<p>Summarise the skills learnt in this module by completing this capstone room for the "Vulnerability Research" module.<br> 

Ackme Support Incorporated has recently set up a new blog. Their developer team have asked for a security audit to be performed before they create and publish articles to the public.<br>

It is your task to perform a security audit on the blog; looking for and abusing any vulnerabilities that you find.</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Exploit the Machine (Flag Submission)</h2>

<p>Deploy the vulnerable machine attached to this by pressing the green "Start Machine" button. It is <code>recommended</code> that you use the TryHackMe AttackBox to complete this room.<br>

Allow <code>five minutes</code> to pass before attempting to attack the vulnerable machine <code>MACHINE_IP</code>.</p>
<br>

> 2.1 - <em>Deploy the vulnerable machine attached to this task & wait <code>five minutes</code> before visiting the vulnerable machine.</em><br>

<p>I did not continue using the file I downloaded from Exploit DB because it was presenting an error.</p>
<p>Proceeded copying the fololowing:  <a href="https://gist.github.com/anir0y/8529960c18e212948b0e40ed1fb18d6d#file-fuel-cms-py">Vulnerability Capstone</a><br>
I set a listener on my <code> Attacke Machine</code>code, and run the exploit with <code>python</code> against the <code>target machine</code>.</p>
