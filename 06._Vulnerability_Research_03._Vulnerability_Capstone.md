<p>Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure. It´s key part of my 29-day-streak in <a href="https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/">WiCyS SANS Security Training</a> Stage 2 Program.<br><br>
Let´s get started!!<br><br>
Access this TryHackMe Room clicking <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/vulnerabilitycapstone">Vulnerability Capstone</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 1 - Introduction</h2>
<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e825e1c-083d-48a6-a2ed-f82fc8c22784)

<p>Summarise the skills learnt in this module by completing this capstone room for the "Vulnerability Research" module.<br> 

Ackme Support Incorporated has recently set up a new blog. Their developer team have asked for a security audit to be performed before they create and publish articles to the public.<br>

It is your task to perform a security audit on the blog; looking for and abusing any vulnerabilities that you find.</p>

> 1.1 - <em>Let's get hacking.</em><br>
>> <code><strong>No answer needed</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 2 - Exploit the Machine (Flag Submission)</h2>

<p>Deploy the vulnerable machine attached to this by pressing the green "Start Machine" button. It is <code>recommended</code> that you use the TryHackMe AttackBox to complete this room.<br>

Allow <code>five minutes</code> to pass before attempting to attack the vulnerable machine <code>MACHINE_IP</code>.</p>

<p>For example, the vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands of pounds for a year's license will likely be used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits. If you’d like to know more about Nessus, check out the TryHackMe room dedicated to it.<br>

I have detailed some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner in the table below:</p>

<p>Frameworks such as Metasploit often have vulnerability scanners for some modules; this is something you will come onto learn about in a further module in this pathway.<br>

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.<br>

Ultimately, both techniques involve testing an application or program for vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include:</p>

<p>If you are keen to learn more about these vulnerabilities, the OWASP framework will be a useful read to you. TryHackMe even has a room showcasing the top ten vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP.</p>
<br>

> 2.1 - <em>You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay).</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Yay</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.2 - <em>You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Injection</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 2.3 - <em>You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Broken Access Control</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>


<h2>Task 3 - Finding Manual Exploits</h2>
<br>

<h3>Rapid7</h3>
<p>Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1af542e2-c4a9-4951-82d9-aab2ba963c94)

<p>Additionally, the database contains instructions for exploiting applications using the popular Metasploit tool (you will learn about this tool in-depth later in the learning path). For example, this entry on Rapid7 is for “Wordpress Plugin SP Project & Document”, where we can see instructions on how to use an exploit module to abuse this vulnerability.

<h3>Github</h3>
<p>GitHub is a popular web service designed for software developers. The site is used to host and share the source code of applications to allow a collaborative effort. However, security researchers have taken to this platform because of the aforementioned reasons as well. Security researchers store & share PoC’s (Proof of Concept) on GitHub, turning it into an exploit database in this context.<br>

GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload – there is no formal verification process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that said, there is also a downside in that PoC’s may not work where little to no support will be provided.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21999229-8fe7-4651-a3b6-b6c540194e14)

<p>GitHub uses a tagging and keyword system, meaning that we can search GitHub by keywords such as “PoC”, “vulnerability”, and many more. At the time of writing, there are 9,682 repositories with the keyword “cve”. We are also able to filter the results by programming language.</p>

<h3>Searchsploit</h3>
<p>Searchsploit is a tool that is available on popular pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux. It is also available on the TryHackMe AttackBox. This tool is an offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on your system.<br>

You are able to search searchsploit by application name and/or vulnerability type. For example, in the snippet below, we are searching searchsploit for exploits relating to Wordpress that we can use – no downloading necessary!</p>

<br>

> 3.1 - <em>What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Github</stron></code><br>
<p><br></p>

> 3.2 - <em>You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Searchsploit</strong></code><br>

<h2>Task 4 - Example of Manual Exploitation</h2>
<p>We can use the information gathered from task 2 in this room to exploit the vulnerable service. Ultimately, one of the most effective vulnerabilities that we can exploit is the ability to execute commands on the target that is running the vulnerable application or service.<br>

For example, being able to execute commands on the target that is running the vulnerable application or service will allow us to read files or execute commands that we previously wouldn’t be able to perform using the application or service alone. Additionally, we can abuse this to gain what is known as a foothold to the machine. A foothold is an access to the vulnerable machine’s console, where we can then begin to exploit other applications or machines on the network.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee94515a-078e-4712-bedd-29e2d0dc7937)

<p>We are going to use an exploit to perform remote code execution on the application from task 2 to be able to remotely execute commands on the vulnerable machine.<br>

Before we start, it is important to note that exploits rarely come out of the box and are ready to be used. They often require some configuration before they will work for our environment or target. The level of configuration will vary upon the exploit, so you will often find multiple exploits for the same vulnerability on an application. It is up to you to figure out which exploit is the most appropriate or useful to you.<br>

For example, in the snippet below, we can see that a few options have been changed to reflect the IP address of the machine that we are attacking from.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/206f7dbe-d901-454a-97e6-d459da2be1df)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1151b47-2772-444a-8676-415251e9b860)

<p>Once we have configured the exploit correctly, let’s further read this exploit to understand how to use it. In the snippet below, we can see that we need to provide two arguments when running the exploit:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3651f0-abc1-4e92-ab63-d53e318940f2)

<p>With this information in mind, we are now ready to use this exploit on the vulnerable machine. We are going to do the following:</p>

<ol type="1. ">
  <li>Use the exploit to upload a malicious file to the vulnerable application containing whatever command we wish to execute, where the web server will run this malicious file to execute the code.</li>
  <li>The file will first contain a basic command that we will use to verify that the exploit has worked.</li>
  <li>Then we are going to read the contents of a file located on the vulnerable machine.</li>
</ol></p>

> 4.1 - <em>What type of vulnerability was used in this attack?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></code><br>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Task 5 - Practical: Manual Exploitation</h2>

<p><code>Note</code>: You will need to either deploy the AttackBox or connect to the TryHackMe network to complete this task.</p>
<br>
<p>Deploy the machine attached to this task and <code>wait a minimum of five minutes</code> for it to be fully set up. After five minutes, visit the webserver running on the machine by navigating to http://MACHINE_IP in the browser of the device connected to the THM network (your own or the AttackBox).</p>

> 5.1 - <em>Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application?</em><br>
>> <code><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></code><br>
